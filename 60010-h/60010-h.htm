<h1>THE UP GRADE</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Stephen Loring sat on the edge of
the sidewalk, his feet in the gutter. He
was staring vacantly at the other side of
the street, completely oblivious of his surroundings.
No one would select a Phœnix sidewalk
as an attractive resting-place, unless, like Loring,
he were compelled by circumstances over
which he had ceased to have control.</p>

<p>“Here, ‘Hombre’! How are you stacking
up? Do you want a job?”</p>

<p>With an uncertain “Yes,” Loring arose from
the sidewalk, before looking at the man who addressed
him. Turning, he saw a brisk, sandy
whiskered man about forty-five years of age,
who fairly beamed with efficiency, and whose
large protruding eyes seemed to see in every
direction at once.</p>

<p>The questioner looked only for a second at
the man before him. The face told its own
story—the story of a man who had quit. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
tired eyes half apologized for the lines beneath
them.</p>

<p>“Easterner,” decided the prospective employer,
“since he wears a belt and not suspenders.”
The stranger extended his hand in
an energetic manner, and continued: “My
name is McKay. The Quentin Mining Company,
up in the hills, want men. They sent me
down to round up a few. You are the forty-first
man, and the boss bet me that I would only
get forty.”</p>

<p>Loring’s head was still swimming as the result
of a period of drunkenness which only lack
of funds had brought to a close. By way of answer
he merely nodded wearily and murmured:
“My name is Loring.”</p>

<p>His taciturnity in no wise discouraged his
interlocutor, for the latter paused merely to
wipe the perspiration from his forehead with a
handkerchief which might possibly once have
been white. Then, slipping his arm through
Loring’s, he went on with his communications:
“The boss bet me I would lose half the men I
got, but they will have their troubles trying to
lose me. Come right along down to the station!
I have them all corralled there with a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
watching them. I don’t suppose you have such
a hell of a lot of packing to do,” he drawled,
looking at Loring’s disheveled apparel with a
comprehending smile. “I went broke myself
once in ’Frisco. Why, Phœnix is a gold mine
for opportunities compared with that place!
I’ll set you up to a drink now. There is nothing
like it to clear your head.”</p>

<p>During this running fire of talk, McKay had
convoyed Loring to a saloon. The proprietor
was sitting listlessly behind a roulette wheel,
idly spinning it, the while he made imaginary
bets with himself on the results, and was seemingly
as elated or depressed as if he had really
won or lost money. Observing the entrance of
the two men, he rose and sauntered over behind
the bar.</p>

<p>“What will you have, gents?”</p>

<p>“I guess about two whiskies,” answered
McKay. “Will you have something with us?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind if I do take a cigar,”
answered the barkeeper, as, after pouring their
drink, he stretched his arm into the dirty glass
case. Then he aimed an ineffectual blow with
a towel at the flies on the dirty mirror, and returned
to his wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>McKay wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand, and licked the last drops of whisky
from his mustache. Then again taking Loring
by the arm, he stepped out into the street.
The heat, as they walked toward the railroad
tracks, was terrific. The dusty stretch of road
which led to the station shimmered with the
glare. No one who could avoid it moved. In
the shade of the buildings, the dogs sprawled
limply. Now and then riders passed at a slow
gait, the horses a mass of lather and dusty sweat.
One poor animal loped by, driven on by spur,
with head down, and tail too dejected to switch
off the flies.</p>

<p>Loring watched him. “I think,” he mused,
“that that poor horse feels as I do. Only he
has not the alleviating satisfaction of knowing
that he is to blame for it himself.”</p>

<p>The station platform was crowded with battered
specimens of Mexican peons, chattering
in high-pitched, slurred syllables. Their
swarthy faces immeasurably irritated Stephen.
Three white men, standing a little apart, looked
rather scornfully at the crowd. The only difference
in their appearance, however, was that
while each of the white men had two suspenders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the overalls of each of the Mexicans were supported
by only one. It would have been hard
to gather together a more bedraggled set of men
than these were; but McKay counted them with
loving pride.</p>

<p>“Forty-one! All here!” he exclaimed.
“Hop aboard the train, boys; we’re off!”</p>

<p>“Railway fare comes out of your first two
days’ work,” he exclaimed cheerfully to Loring.</p>

<p>The train was of the “mixed” type that
crawls about the southwest. A dingy, battered,
passenger coach trailed at the end of a long line
of freight cars, which were labeled for the most
part with the white circle and black cross of
the “Atcheson, Topeka and Santa Fé.” The
men scrambled aboard, the engine grunted
lazily, protestingly, and the long train slowly
started. Until the train was well under way,
McKay stood with his broad back against the
door, his hand lying nonchalantly but significantly
on a revolver beneath his vest, then, with
a contented smile, he dropped into a seat.</p>

<p>Loring had no hat. In Arizona, a man may
go without his trousers, and be called eccentric.
To go without a hat is ungentlemanly. Consequently
the three other white men whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
McKay had collected kept themselves aloof,
and Stephen, crawling into a seat beside a
voluble Chinaman, dozed off in misery, wondering
whether the murmuring buzz that he heard
was in his head, or in the car wheels. The
Chinaman looked down at Stephen’s unshaven
face and matted hair, and grinned pleasantly.</p>

<p>“He allee samee broke,” he murmured to
himself, crooning with pleasure.</p>

<p>For six hours the train had been plowing
its way across the desert, backing, stopping,
groaning, wheezing. The blue line of the hills
seemed little nearer than in the morning. Only
the hills behind seemed farther away. Now
and then, far out in the sage-brush, a film of
dust hung low in the air, telling of some sheep
outfit driving to new grazing lands. On the
side of the train next Loring, a trail followed
the line of the telegraph poles. Wherever the
trail crossed the track and ran for a while on the
opposite side, Stephen felt a childish anger at it,
for otherwise he could amuse himself by counting
the skeletons of horses and cattle, which
every mile or so made splatches of pure white
against the gray white of the dust. The passengers
slouched in the hot seats, rolling countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
cigarettes with the dexterity which marks
the Southwesterner, drawing the string of the
“Durham” sack with a quick jerk of the teeth,
at the close of the operation. The air of the car
reeked with smoke. At each little station-shed
new men joined the crowd, being received with
looks of silent sympathy and invariably proffering
a request for the “makings.” When this
was received, they resignedly settled on the torn
black leather of the seats, trying to accomplish
the impossible feat of resting their necks on the
edge of the backs without cramping their legs
against the seats in front of them.</p>

<p>The train stopped suddenly with a jerk which
was worse than usual, as if the engine had
stumbled over itself. The brakeman, a target
for many jests, hurried through the car.</p>

<p>“What have we stopped for now?” drawled
McKay. “To enjoy the scenic effect?”</p>

<p>“Horse runned along ahead of the engine and
bust his leg in the trestle,” laconically answered
the brakeman.</p>

<p>“The son-of-a-gun! Now, the critter showed
durned poor judgment, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>The brakeman swore mildly, and disappeared.
In a few minutes he returned, carefully spat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the empty stove, and the train casually moved
on again.</p>

<p>Seeing a paper lying in the aisle, as he walked
down the car, the brakeman stooped and picked
it up. His eye fell upon a large red seal, and
much elaborate writing. With a puzzled expression
he read the document.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">United States of America. Department of State.</span></p>

<p>“To all whom these presents may concern, Greeting.
I, the undersigned, Secretary of State, of the United States
of America, hereby request all whom it may concern to
permit—Stephen Loring—a citizen of the United States,
safely and freely to pass, and in case of need to give him
all lawful aid and protection.”</p>

</div>

<p>“It must be a passport,” he thought.
“First one I ever seed, though. I wonder who
might Stephen Loring be.”</p>

<p>His eye fell upon the appended description:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<ul>
<li>“Age, 23 yrs., 4 mos.</li>
<li>Stature, 6 ft. 1.</li>
<li>Forehead, Broad.</li>
<li>Eyes, Brown.</li>
<li>Nose, Irregular.</li>
<li>Mouth, Wide.</li>
<li>Chin, Medium.</li>
<li>Hair, Black.</li>
<li>Complexion, Ruddy.</li>
<li>Face, Square.”</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>He looked about at the men in the car until
his eye fell on Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s him, all right,” he thought. “I
should say it would be sort of inconvenient to
have such a good description to fill!”</p>

<p>He went to Stephen and touched him on the
shoulder. “Hey, stranger, I reckon this belongs
to you.”</p>

<p>Loring, surprised, took the proffered paper.
Then he felt in the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“I think it must have fallen out of my pocket.
Much obliged!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was an old passport, expired ten years since,
but Stephen carried it about with him as a
means of identification in case of accident.</p>

<p>“How did you know that this was mine?”
he asked the brakeman from idle curiosity.</p>

<p>The man pointed with an exceedingly dirty
thumb to the description.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no detective, but I reckon that fits
pretty well.” Then he nodded to Loring and
walked away.</p>

<p>Loring glanced idly at the passport as it lay
open on his knee. As he did so he wondered
what the friends who knew him ten years back,
at the time when that document was issued,
would say to his appearance now. “Wild oats
gone to seed. I guess that about describes me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he murmured, with a grim smile, as he folded
the passport and slipped it back into the frayed
lining of his pocket. Dissipation and wreck do
not change the color of a man’s eyes, the shape
of his forehead or the outline of his face, so
that it had still been possible to recognize Loring
by his old passport. Had it been a description
of his personality instead of his measurements,
no one could have recognized the original.
Mathematically it is but the difference of an
inch from a retreating chin to one thrust forward;
artistically a very slight touch will turn
frank eyes into hopeless ones; philosophically
the turning of the corners of the lips downward
instead of upward may change the whole viewpoint
of life. Experience is mathematician,
artist, and philosopher combined, and it had
accomplished all these changes in Stephen
Loring.</p>

<p>Through the parting kindness of friends,
most of the men had some food, which they
proceeded to chew with noisy satisfaction.
Loring began to feel cravings. The Chinaman
beside him was gnawing at a huge ham sandwich
with a very green pickle protruding from
between the edges of the bread. He eyed Loring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
then turned to him and asked: “You hab
bite? My name Hop Wah. I go cook for the
outfit. Me heap fine cook,” solemnly added
the celestial.</p>

<p>Loring gratefully shared the food.</p>

<p>The men in the car, who until now had been
rather morose and silent, began to cheer up,
and to sing noisily. Loring lazily wondered
why, until he saw several black bottles passed
promiscuously about. McKay handed his own
flask to Loring.</p>

<p>“Have another drink!” he said, “there is
nothing like it for a hang-over.”</p>

<p>Loring took a deep pull at the flask.</p>

<p>“Hey, Chink, have some?” continued
McKay.</p>

<p>Wah smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink, eh? Well, I’ll bet then that
you are strong on dope,” said McKay, as he
returned the flask to his pocket.</p>

<p>Night began to turn the color of the hills to a
rich cobalt. Now and then the train crawled
past shacks whose evening fires were beginning
to twinkle in the dusk. Little camps scattered
in the niches of the foothills showed gray and
blurred. Jagged masses of rock, broken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cuts and hollows, now overshadowed the train.
Giant cacti, growing at impossible angles from
pinnacles and crevasses, loomed against the
sky line. As the hills shut in, the roar of the
train echoed of a sudden louder and louder
where the desert runs flat as a board to the hills,
and then with no transition becomes the hills.</p>

<p>“Only fifteen miles more now, boys,” sang
out McKay; “but it may take two hours,” he
added under his breath.</p>

<p>Cheered by this announcement, one of the
Mexicans groped under his seat and produced
a large nondescript bundle, which, after sundry
cuttings of string, and unwrapping of paper,
resolved itself into a guitar. Then, after fishing
in his pockets, he produced a mouth-organ with
two clamps attached. Loring, for want of
better occupation, watched him. The man
deftly fastened the harmonica to the edge of
the guitar. Then slinging the dirty red guitar
ribbon over his neck, he played a few warning
chords. When the attention of all was
fixed upon him, he bent his head over the
mouth-organ, and strumming the guitar accompaniment
with sweeping strokes, rendered a
selection that had once been “A Georgia Camp-Meeting.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The applause being generous, the
artist threw himself into the spirit of his performance.</p>

<p>“Thees time—with variations,” he exclaimed
excitedly. And they were variations!</p>

<p>McKay regarded his flock with genial interest.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he the musical boy, though?” he observed
to Loring.</p>

<p>“Playing those two together is quite a trick,”
thought Loring; “I must learn it.” Then he
realized that he could not even play either
singly. Such impulses and awakenings were
frequent with him. Constructively he felt himself
capable of doing almost anything. The
ridiculousness of his thought aroused him from
his lethargy, and he began to hum softly the
tune that car wheels always play.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the engine gave a last exhausted
wheeze, and stopped. “Quentin. All
ashore!” called out McKay.</p>

<p>The men took their bundles from the racks,
crowded down the aisle, and out to the rickety
station platform, where the ticket agent, lantern
in hand, looked at them wonderingly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t lose a man on the trip,” McKay
said to the agent, in answer to the latter’s query<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of “What in <em>hell</em>?” “Well, boys,” went on
McKay, “it is ten miles to where we camp, and
there ain’t no hearses, so I guess we’ll have a
nice little moonlight stroll.”</p>

<p>The station settlement of Quentin consisted
of a few scattered tents, and of five saloons, with
badly spelled signs. One shack bore in large
letters the proud legend: “Grocery Store.” It
had evidently been adopted as a residence, for
in smaller letters beneath the sign was painted:
“This ain’t no store—Keep out!” Loring,
with lazy amusement, read this evidence of a
shiftlessness greater than his own.</p>

<p>The crowd began to gravitate toward the
saloons. “Hey, other way there!” shouted
McKay, for he well knew that if the crowd began
drinking there, very few would reach camp.
A big Mexican, who had been imbibing heavily
on the train, lurched toward the saloons, bellowing:
“Me much <i lang="es">mal’ hombre</i>. I take a drink
when I damn please!”</p>

<p>“You much <i lang="es">mal’ hombre</i>, eh?” said McKay,
smiling. “Then take that!” He stepped up to
the man, and let drive a blow from one shoulder
that almost broke the mutineer’s jaw. The man
staggered, then turned and ran, but up the trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
The other men howled with laughter, then they
picked up their blanket rolls and bundles, and
laughing and singing started up the trail, where
the deep shadows of the tall suwaras made black
streaks against the white porphyry of the projecting
cliffs.</p>

<p>Loring and Hop Wah followed at the end of
the procession, the former consoling himself for
his lack of blankets by thinking how much
easier walking was without them; the latter
cheerfully singing a song of which verse, chorus,
and <i lang="fr">envoi</i> were: “La la boom boom! La la
boom boom!” If this were lacking in originality,
it was at least capable of infinite repetition,
and it turned out to be Wah’s one musical
number.</p>

<p>Mile after mile up the trail toiled the straggling
line, the Mexicans calling loudly to each
other, or mocking with jeering whoops the unfortunates
who slipped on the loose stones.
McKay, chuckling to himself with pleasure, led
the little band. He was thinking of the expressions
of praise and surprise, of the congratulations
upon the successful outcome of his expedition,
which would be bestowed upon him in camp.</p>

<p>Immediately ahead of Loring walked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
three other white men of the collection. The
volubility of their cursing, as they stumbled
along, caused McKay to drop back to them.
After the customary greeting of “Well, gents,
how are you stacking up?” he began to probe
into the cause of their discontent.</p>

<p>“What’s the work, boss, anyhow?” they
asked.</p>

<p>“Can you ‘polish’ the head of a drill?”
asked McKay. He inquired as a matter of
form, for one glance at their slouching shoulders
and their thin chests had given him his answer.
“Can’t?” he observed cheerfully. “Well, I
guess your work will be ‘mucking’ on a narrow
gauge railway grade that we are building.”</p>

<p>“Mucking!” growled one. “Ain’t there
nothing else that we can do besides scratch
around with a pick and shovel?”</p>

<p>“Well, Sullivan, it is that at first. Later, if
I can get you a job out at the main camp, I
will. It is sort of hard on you fellows to have to
grub with all these ‘Mex’ at the road camp; but
as soon as you get a little ‘time’ saved up you
can start in buying your own stuff and messing
together.”</p>

<p>“Save up ‘time’!” exclaimed Sullivan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
“Hell! There ain’t no use savin’ anything in
this Gawd-forsaken country.”</p>

<p>“Well, cheer up, anyway!” laughed McKay.
“Here is the ground where the road camp lies.”
Several camp-fires blazed suddenly out of the
darkness. Around them many shadowy figures
were grouped. These gathered with interest
about the newcomers, noisily commenting upon
their appearance. “Here we are, boys. The tents
ain’t down here yet; but sleeping out of doors is
powerful healthy. Sure Mike!” he added, poking
a grinning Mexican boy in the ribs. “<i lang="es">Seguro
Miguel!</i> Nothing like it, is there, Pedro?”</p>

<p>“How about the rattle-bugs, Boss?” asked
Sullivan, the malcontent.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no rattlesnakes out in April.
Besides, if there was, they would not bite your
carcass,” answered McKay, irritated by the
man’s attitude of continual grumbling.</p>

<p>The men all busied themselves unrolling
their blankets and looking for sheltered places
in which to sleep. Loring was not accustomed
to construction camps. He thought that for
the white men, at least, sleeping accommodations
must have been provided.</p>

<p>“Where can I sleep?” he asked McKay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter grinned from one big ear to the
other. “Say,” he drawled, “that’s good!
Your hot bath ain’t ready though. Haven’t
got any blankets, have you?” he added, relenting
a bit. “Better crawl in with some one
to-night. To-morrow, when I come down here
from the copper camp, I’ll bring you a pair. I
guess you won’t skip till you have done enough
work to pay for them, as you won’t have money
enough to vamos. And, say, I’ve got a swell
hat that I will give you. It ain’t respectable or
refined like not to have one.”</p>

<p>The rough kindness touched Loring deeply,
and he began to thank him warmly.</p>

<p>McKay uttered a brisk good night and turned
to walk up the trail which led to the main camp,
two miles beyond. The Mexican whom the
boss had knocked down at the station stepped
suddenly forward. Expecting trouble, Loring
jumped to his feet. He heard McKay say: “I
guess the señorita won’t think much of your
beauty now, will she, Manuel? I’ll send the
doctor down in the morning to fix up that face
of yours.” The Mexican, instead of rushing
at McKay, exclaimed excitedly: “Oh, boss, you
just like a father to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Still smiling at the sudden change of temper
Loring lay down on the ground, and tried to
sleep. The knife-like cold of the Arizona night
made him shiver. Striving to keep warm, he
rolled from side to side. Suddenly, from out of
the darkness near him, he heard a soft laugh:
“Hey, me bludder, Hop Wah got plenty blankets.
Roll here!” Gratefully he crawled in
between the Chinaman’s blankets. Wah looked
at him curiously. “La la boom boom,” he
crooned to himself. “Heap lot whisky.” Then
he turned over and went peacefully to sleep.</p>

<p>Loring lay rigidly upon his back. Conscience,
remorse, and a rock beneath his fourth rib, all
kept him awake. The stars did not answer his
half-framed questions, so he shut his eyes. It
is hard to think when the eyes are closed, so he
opened them again. It was a very simple question
that he reiterated to the shadows, to the
embers of the fire, and to the drone of the
Gila river. It consisted of one word—“Why?”
There was no need of his asking any one except
himself; but he put off as long as possible asking
the one person who could answer, for he <span class="smcap">knew</span>
why. His friends had always been so ready to
make excuses for his shortcomings, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
graciousness he could do no less than acquiesce.
But in spite of the veil with which memory surrounds
facts, when a man lies awake at night
he is likely to see them as they are.</p>

<p>That both of Stephen’s parents had died
when he was a child was no answer to the question
which he asked of the fire and the river.
His uncle had educated him with an affectionate
insight which no parent could have bettered.
That he had not all along realized what
he was doing was no answer. A keen judge of
men, Loring was an inspired critic of himself.
It was not lack of ambition that had dragged
him down, for always there had been a longing
for those things which were not within his
grasp. There was no inherent vice in his character.
There was courage, loyalty, and kindness.
There was only one thing lacking—some
power to drive the whole.</p>

<p>Most people are either led or pushed through
life. But there are some whose motive power
must come from within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>At half-past six the next morning the
whistle in the upper camp blew long
and clear. It is a strange fact that the
dispassionate whistle in the morning is the
brutal enemy of labor, calling its victims to
the struggle; but that at noon it is impartial and
cheerful. It then attempts the rôle of referee in
the great game between labor and capital and,
like a good umpire, favors neither. Yet the
same whistle at night, when it calls the game
off, becomes the warm ally of the workman,
encouraging him openly with promise of rest
and supper. It is then as if it said to him: “I
was compelled to be impartial. That is my
duty; but frankly, now that it is over, I am glad
that you have won.”</p>

<p>Loring opened his eyes as he heard the morning
whistle, and, at first a little dazed, looked
about him. Then he rose and stretched himself.
Every bone in his body ached as the result of
the night on the hard ground. All around him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
men were yawning sleepily as they crawled out
of their blankets. Close beside the camp ran
the tawny Gila river. Stephen walked down to
the bank, and kneeling on a small rock which
lay half afloat in the ooze mud, endeavored to
wash. Then, refreshed, if not much cleaner,
he made his way to the cook tent. Here under
a fly stretched on poles were four long tables,
heaped with tin plates and condensed milk cans.
The monotony of the table furnishings was
broken by a few dingy cans, decorated with
labels of very red tomatoes, which served as
sugar and salt holders. The old inhabitants of
the camp were noisily greeting the newcomers,
pounding on their cups and whistling whenever
they perceived some old acquaintance.</p>

<p>The labor of the Southwest is of a very vagrant
quality. A man merely works until he has
money enough to move. Each time that he
moves he spends all his money on a celebration,
so that his wanderings, though frequent, are
not long in duration. Thus many of these men
had met before, around the smelters in Globe,
in the Tucson district, or north in the Yavapai.</p>

<p>Loring found a place on one of the rickety
benches, and looked toward the coffee-bucket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Sullivan, who was opposite to him, growled
gloomily: “Say, the grub is rank. This coffee
is festered water.” The description, though
not an appetizing one with which to begin a
meal, was not without truth. In varying degree
it might have been applied to the rest of
the breakfast, from the red, tasteless frijollas to
the stew, which consisted of a few shreds of
over-cooked meat, in the midst of a nondescript
mass of questionable grease.</p>

<p>As Loring had finished eating what he could
of the meal, and was contemplating borrowing
some tobacco, the foremen, who, as etiquette
demands, had eaten their breakfast in a group
apart from the men, began to look at their
watches, and to stir about actively.</p>

<p>“Hurry up now, boys! Out on the grade—quick!
<i lang="es">Vamos!</i> Only five minutes more now!”
they called.</p>

<p>The tools of the old workmen were scattered
along the grade, where each had dropped them
at the end of the previous day’s work. The
newcomers were marched single file, through
the tool-house, where each picked out his implements,
then started off to the place assigned
him. Loring, not from altruism, but because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he did not know the difference which well chosen
tools make in a long day’s toil, made no effort
to grab. In consequence he emerged from the
shed supplied with a split shovel, and a dull,
loose-headed pick. A foreman beckoned him
to a place on the grade, opposite to the cook
tent. He immediately started to swing his pick.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in such a hell of a hurry!” called
Sullivan, “you’ll have plenty to do later.”</p>

<p>The seven o’clock whistle blew sharply.
“Lope her, boys!” sang out the section foreman.
All talking stopped abruptly, and the
click of picks, swung with steady blows, and
the rasp of shovels echoed all along the grade.
Loring, new to “mucking,” swung his pick
with all the strength of his back, bringing it
down, with rigid full arm strokes, upon the
rocky soil. The foreman noticed this with
amusement. “He’ll bust in an hour,” he
thought; but he only said: “Loosen your grip
a bit or you’ll get stone-bruises.” Then he
passed on up the line, to tell a Mexican, who had
already stopped to light a cigarette, that “this
ain’t no rest cure.”</p>

<p>Hop Wah from the depths of the cook tent
perceived Loring’s energetic labors, and called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
out to him: “Hey, me bludder, no swing like
that! No damnee use. Just let him pick fall!”
Stephen nodded gratefully, and complied with
the practical advice. He worked steadily, only
pausing to exchange his pick for a shovel,
whenever he had broken enough earth, or loosened
some large stone. “Surely,” he thought,
“I can keep this up for ten hours. Here, at
last, is a job that I can do.”</p>

<p>Stephen Loring had never in his life “made
good.” He had started well on many ventures,
and then given out. His friends had at first been
intensely admiring, and had predicted great
things for him; but gradually they had given
him up as hopeless. They would have lent him
money cheerfully; but a determination not to
borrow was one of his few virtues. In consequence,
having fallen stage by stage, he was
now reduced to being a day laborer, a
“mucker,” watched by a foreman to see that
he did not shirk. If the same method had
been applied to him earlier, it might have been
his salvation. As it was, he had sunk beneath
the current.</p>

<p>The next hour seemed to Loring twice as
long as the first. His wrist pulsed with agony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
from the jar of the blows. He was compelled
to wrap his handkerchief around his right hand,
as he had worn great blisters sliding it up and
down the pick handle. The sweat, as it rolled
down from his forehead, made his cheeks
smart. Every few minutes he was forced to
rest. At ten o’clock the time-keeper came to
him, and, drawing a shabby brown book from
his pocket, entered Stephen’s name on the rolls.
Then he drew from his pocket and handed to
Loring a brass tag, like a baggage check.
“Your number is four fifty-three; keep this
now!”</p>

<p>Stephen looked at the tag for a second, then
slipped it into his pocket. It did not jangle
against anything. He leaned on his pick handle
for a moment, and with mild interest listened
to the time-keeper, as he accosted the Mexican
who was working next to him.</p>

<p>“Eh, <i lang="es">hombre</i>! What’s your name? <i lang="es">Cómo
se llama?</i>”</p>

<p>The foreman spoke sharply to Stephen, and
with the blood rising slightly to his temples at
the rebuke, he fell to work again.</p>

<p>Loring possessed a strong imagination and
he had solaced many a hardship by either planning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for pleasanter occupations in the future,
or vividly reconstructing worse ones in the past.
But imagination is a dangerous plaything. The
men working on either side of him thought of
nothing, except perhaps some solution of the
great problem of the human race, how to make
the greatest possible show of work with the least
effort. Stephen, however, was accompanied in
his work by imagination. To-day it was of a
sort which was neither subtle nor pleasant. It
began by saying to him: “You are healthy.
You will probably live for thirty years or more.
They will be pleasant years, won’t they? There
are three hundred and sixty-five days in a year,
so if you work ten hours a day for thirty years,
perhaps you may grow used to work. Work is
a great companion, is it not, Stephen? It is
unfortunate,” finished imagination glibly, “that
you must do this forever.”</p>

<p>Loring spoke aloud in answer to his imagination,
timing his syllables to the already shortened
strokes of his pick. “Not forever?”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined imagination, “I see no alternative,
do you? And what is more,” added
the Devil who at this moment was operating
imagination, “<em>You</em> are not even building the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
railroad. All <em>you</em> are doing is moving rocks.
<em>Any one</em> can move rocks.”</p>

<p>By noon time Stephen was limp and exhausted.
The hour’s respite seemed to him to
go by like a flash, and he started upon the afternoon’s
work in a hopeless frame of mind, his
muscles stiffened instead of rested by the short
relaxation.</p>

<p>After an hour’s labor, he moved to a place
where the ground was soft, and for a while his
delight in this supported him. It is little things
such as this which make the epochs in a day of
manual labor. As he toiled on grimly, in a few
short hours, he had reversed his views on
Socialism.</p>

<p>“Of course the laborer is the chief factor in
production,” he murmured wearily to himself,
as he grew more and more dizzy.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, McKay, with a surveying
party, reached the section of the grade where
Loring was working. Stephen watched him,
as he stooped over the level and waved his
hand up and down. He heard him shout “O. K.
back sight! Ready fore sight!” Then “O. K.
fore sight! <i lang="es">’Sta ’ueno!</i>” and somehow the
cheery tones braced Loring for his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>McKay, as he came up, nodded cheerfully:
“I left that hat for you in the cook
tent,” he said; “it will make you look like
a real man!” Then noticing the agonized
swings of the pick, he looked at Loring
quizzically.</p>

<p>“Say, I reckon you ain’t done this sort of
thing for some time, have you? I guess a short
spell at flagging wouldn’t discourage you. Go
up to the tool-house, and get a white flag that
you’ll find there. Then go up to that point
back there, where the wagon road crosses the
grade. I’ll put another flagman on the point
below, and when he waves, you stop anything
that comes along. In a few minutes we are
going to “shoot” all along here, and I don’t
want to blow up any teams or people that are
going up to the copper camp.”</p>

<p>Loring dropped his pick with alacrity, and
started for the tool-shed. As he walked back
along the grade, he looked with curious interest
at the men who were still working. Somehow
their labors seemed a part of himself. His
back ached sympathetically as they stooped to
their work. At the shed he found the dirty
white rag and stick which served for flagging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Then he hurried to his place. He passed Sullivan,
who waved joyously to him.</p>

<p>“The boss has set me flagging, too. Gee, what
a graft! Me for a nap, as soon as they start to
shoot. There won’t any teams go by, when
they hear the shots, and I can get a good sleep.”</p>

<p>“You had better not,” answered Loring.
Then, feeling that it was none of his business,
he went on to the place which McKay had assigned
to him. He seated himself on a large
rock, from which he could see far in all directions.
He was at the end of the grade nearest
to the copper camp, and he could see the great
iron chimneys of the smelter, protruding above
the hills to the north, belching forth black
smoke against the brilliant blue of the sky.
“The whole country looks as if it had been
made with a hack-saw,” he mused, as he looked
at the jagged rocks and irregular mountains
about him. “I would give a great deal to see
something green besides this accursed cactus;
but I suppose that grass and civilization go
together.”</p>

<p>Then, watching for a signal, he fixed his eyes
on the point of rock where Sullivan was stationed.
After a few minutes he saw, against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the brown background of the rocks, a spot of
white move quickly up and down. He immediately
ran out into the road, and stopped a line
of coke teams that was coming down from the
camp. The drivers merely threw on their
brakes, and let the thin-boned, almost transparent
horses tug uselessly at the traces, until
they discovered the vainness of the effort. Then
horses, like drivers, relapsed into the comatose
acceptance of conditions, which in the land of
the cactus becomes part of man and beast.
McKay came up on horseback, calling out to
the first of the drivers: “Hold your horses!
The e-l-ephants are about to pass!” The
Mexican, just as though he had understood,
grinned, then again dozed off.</p>

<p>One by one, far down the grade, little puffs
of smoke began to curl at the places where the
drillers’ gangs had been working. The men,
howling in mock terror, came tearing past the
place where Loring and McKay were standing.
They would run several hundred yards further
than safety required in order to delay by a few
moments their return to work when the blasting
was finished. As the men surged by, McKay,
in spite of his disgust, grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Trust a Mex to find some way to shorten
work,” he said to Loring. In rapid succession
the “shots” began to go off; whole sections of
the cliffs seemed to swell, then gave forth a fat
volume of smoke, and finally burst, hurling
fragments of brown-black rock against the sky
line. Then, a fraction of an instant later, the
dull, muffled boom carried to the ear.</p>

<p>“Regular bombardment, ain’t it!” exclaimed
McKay. “Wo-op! duck!” As a large jagged
piece of shale came whizzing over their heads
he and Loring simultaneously dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it funny?” said McKay, as they got
to their feet again. “Now time and again these
things won’t go fifty feet, then all of a sudden
they chase a fellow who is a quarter of a mile
away.”</p>

<p>The heaviest “shot” of all was to be fired in
a place near Loring’s position, where a deep
spur of black diorite protruded across the grade.
During five days gangs had been drilling on
this spur, so that its face was honeycombed with
ten deep holes, for diorite is almost as hard as
iron, and to make any impression upon it requires
an immense load of powder. McKay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
himself had superintended the loading, patting
the charges firmly down with the tamping rod,
until, as he expressed it, he had enough powder
there to “blow hell up to heaven.” They had
waited to fire these “shots” until the last of the
others had exploded, and now the little group
of men who were nearest began to look everywhere
for shelter. The waiting teams were
backed up close against the ledge, while the
drivers crawled underneath the wagons for protection.
Loring and McKay stood beside a
large boulder, behind which they could drop
when the explosion came. Into every niche
men crawled, waiting for the shock.</p>

<p>The foreman bent over the first fuse, and a
wisp of thin blue smoke arose at the touch of his
hand.</p>

<p>“Hope he ain’t cut the fuses too long,”
growled McKay anxiously. “If one of those
loads misses fire, it won’t be safe to work in this
neighborhood.” The foreman stepped quickly
from fuse to fuse, and spurt after spurt of
smoke began to curl from the rock, some hanging
low, some rising. The foreman stooped
over one of the fuses for a second time.</p>

<p>“It’s missed!” exclaimed McKay. “No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he’s got it. Hey, <em>beat</em> it! Quick!” he shouted,
as the thin smoke began to turn from whitish-blue
to yellow-brown. The foreman ran back a
up the grade towards them.</p>

<p>“The damned fool!” breathed McKay.
“Like as not he’ll kill himself, and it will take
me a week to find another man who can shoot
the way he can. About thirty seconds more,
and that rock is going to jump!”</p>

<p>Loring raised his eyes. Far down the grade,
beyond the point, he saw a speck. The speck
grew larger and became a horse and rider.</p>

<p>McKay saw it too. “Sullivan will warn him,”
he said tersely. “My God!” he yelled, “it’s a
woman, and her pony is running away.”</p>

<p>Loring made a jump into the grade and
dashed towards the smoke. The yellow-brown
turned to the black-brown that just precedes
an explosion. It poured forth from the ground
like a volcano.</p>

<p>“He can’t even reach the ‘shots,’” gasped
McKay. “Oh, my God, where was the other
flagman! Only fifty yards more—He must
make it!—He will!—He’s reached the spot;
he’s past it. He will—God, and there’s ten
shots there!” Even as he spoke the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the earth belched forth rumbling thunder
and burst into fragments. McKay dropped
flat on the ground, behind the sheltering boulder.
A great cloak of brown smoke punctured with
huge black rocks shut out the scene. Then,
with dull, splashing thuds, the rocks began to
fall into the muddy river which dragged itself
along beside the grade. First came a few
solemn splashes as the large rocks fell, then
faster, a very hailstorm of fragments, as the
smaller pieces showered down. The Mexicans
were cursing frantically, adding to the roar a
shrill pitch.</p>

<p>The first three “shots” went off in lightning
succession. A pause, then two more.</p>

<p>“Five!” yelled McKay.</p>

<p>Then three more “shots” boomed deeply.
McKay and the foreman knelt behind the boulder,
pale, breathing hard, striving to guess what
lay behind that wall of smoke. Another pause,
then a terrific report.</p>

<p>“Nine, only one more!” shouted the foreman.
They waited ten seconds,—no other
shot. Then ten seconds more. They rose to
their feet and started forward. “Two must
have gone off at once,” yelled McKay. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
roar, and they had barely time to reach
cover before the shower of rocks again fell.</p>

<p>“<em>Ten!</em> Come on!” roared McKay. The
rocks had hardly fallen, before he, followed by
a dozen others, was rushing through the smoke
to what he knew must be beyond. The grade
was blocked with great masses of rock, and by
the time they had climbed over these barriers,
the smoke had cleared.</p>

<p>They found Loring lying on his face, his right
hand still grasping the bridle of the dead horse.
The girl was kneeling beside him. As McKay
reached her side, he recognized the daughter of
the manager of the mine. He raised her to her
feet, while as if dazed by the miracle he repeated:
“You ain’t hurt, Miss Cameron? You ain’t
hurt?” She shook herself free from him, then
knelt again by Stephen, trying to stanch with
her handkerchief the blood that was flowing
from a great cut in his temple. She looked up
at McKay with an anxious appeal in her eyes.
“Is he dead?” she asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="440" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“The girl was kneeling beside him.” <a href="#Page_36"><i>Page 36</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>McKay bent over, and opening the rough shirt
felt Loring’s heart. “No, he’s alive still, but he’s
pretty close to gone,” he answered. He untwisted
the tight clenched fingers from the bridle, and half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
raised the unconscious body. It lay limp in his
arms. He turned to one of the foremen who were
gathered around.</p>

<p>“Smith, get a horse and ride like hell for the
company doctor!” The man was off for the
corral in an instant.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss, you just leave him to us!” went on
McKay. “See now, your skirt is getting all blood.”</p>

<p>For reply, she raised Loring’s head gently and
placed it in her lap. “Now, send some one for
blankets and water,” she directed.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Agua</i>, hey, <i lang="es">ag-ua</i>!” shouted McKay, and in
a minute a little pale-faced water boy came stumbling
up with a bucket of muddy water. McKay
looked on in wonder while the girl deftly washed
the dirt from the wounds.</p>

<p>“She has her nerve,” he thought. “There
ain’t nothing like a woman.”</p>

<p>One of the Mexicans came back from the cook
tent with a blanket, and upon this they gently
lifted Stephen. Then four men carried him to the
nearest tent. Jean walked beside them, holding
her wet handkerchief tightly against Loring’s
forehead, in vain attempt to stop the bleeding.
They laid him on the ground, inside the tent.</p>

<p>“Now you must go, Miss Cameron,” implored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
McKay. “I’ll send you up to camp in one of
the teams. Your father would never forgive me
if I let you stay. Why you are as pale as—”</p>

<p>The girl interrupted him decisively. “Are
there any cloths here for bandages?”</p>

<p>He looked hopelessly around the tent with its
pile of dirty quilts.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Jean seized the soft white stock about her neck,
and with a quick tug tore it off. “This will do,”
she breathed, as she placed the impromptu bandage
about Loring’s head.</p>

<p>“Now tie this! I can’t pull it tightly enough.”</p>

<p>McKay drew the ends of the bandage together,
and clumsily knotted them. Then he thought
of his one universal remedy. Meekly turning
to Jean he asked: “How about some whisky
for him?” She nodded, and he drew a flask
from his pocket. With strong fingers he pried
open Stephen’s jaws, and poured the whisky
down his throat. The stimulant brought a slight
color to the mask-like face.</p>

<p>“I guess he would sure enjoy this some, if he
were conscious,” thought McKay grimly. The
men had been sent back to work, and only he and
Miss Cameron knelt in the tent by Stephen, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
anxiously for the slow heart-beats in the big
helpless frame. Then came the pound of horses’
hoofs on the road, the sliding sound of a pony
flung back in full career upon his haunches, and
the doctor stood pulling open the flaps of the tent.
Jean rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“I shall only be in the way now,” she said, and
stepped outside into the vivid sunlight.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Two weeks had passed since the accident.
Loring, whose life had been at first despaired
of, was gaining fast in strength,
and enjoying the first real comfort that he had
known in months. As he lay quietly on the hard
canvas cot, the rough company hospital seemed
to him a dream of luxury.</p>

<p>His cot had been placed close to the door, where
he could look out over the little camp. The early
morning light brought the whiteness of the tents
scattered about the plateau into clear contrast
with the shadowy brownness of the surrounding
mountains, while in the sunlight the yellow
pine framework of the intermingled shacks
sparkled brightly. The smelter pounded away
steadily, great wreaths of smoke pouring from its
chimneys, the blast sucking and breathing like
some huge driven beast. Intermingled with the
sound was the clanging rasp of shovels, as the
smelter stokers piled coke into the furnace. Over
on the far mountain a wood-laden burro train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was picking its way slowly down the trail. In
the thin morning air the tinkle of the bells on the
animals’ necks and the sharp calls of the drivers
carried clear across the valley. Close by the
smelter, in the midst of the coal dust and cinders,
stood a jaded horse, with a harness made of chains.
For two days it had fascinated Loring to see the
deft way in which the driver hooked this horse
to the glowing slag pots, and drove him along
the narrow track that led out on the slag dump.
With the childishness of the sick, he harbored a
deep grudge against the shack, behind which
the horse, with his molten load, would always
disappear. This prevented his seeing the operation
of dumping the slag, which he felt must be
highly interesting. At the other side of the doorway
he could just see the corner of a newly finished
shack. He looked a bit gloomily at the completed
building, for it had been delightful to
watch the carpenters at work upon it. In two
days the whole house had been finished, even
to the tin roofing. This tin roofing, by the
way, had brought Stephen much joy, for the
carpenter’s assistant had laid the plates from
top down, instead of beginning at the bottom,
so that the joints would overlap and be water-tight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
In consequence the whole roofing had
been ripped off and done over again.</p>

<p>The morning shift was just going to work, and
the hurrying groups of men passed the door on
their way up to the mine. At the watering-trough
each stopped, and plunging his canteen deep into
the water, held it there until the burlap and
flannel casing was saturated, ensuring a cooling
drink for them during their work. Loring laughed
at himself when he found himself wishing that
they would not all wear blue denim overalls.</p>

<p>Little water boys struggled past, each with a
pole, like a yoke across his shoulders, from either
end of which hung a bucket. The men greeted
them as they passed, with calls of “Go-od
boy!” “<i lang="es">Bueno muchacho!</i>” Several of the men,
as they passed, greeted Stephen with shy exclamations
of “<i lang="es">Eh, amigo—Cóm’ estamos?</i>” Then
they went on to their work beneath the ground.
Loring was touched by these inquiries for his
welfare, and smiled in a friendly fashion at
each.</p>

<p>Loring’s smile had been one of his worst
enemies, for it had so often prevented people
from telling him what they thought of him. It
combined a sensitiveness which was unexplained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
by the rather heavy molding of his chin, with a
humor which only one who had carefully studied
his eyes would be prepared for. It was an exasperating
smile to those who did not like him,
for it possessed a quality of goodness and strength
to which they thought he had no right as an accompaniment
to his character. On the other
hand, it was one of the attributes which most
strongly attracted his friends. It was not an analytical
smile, so it put him in touch with unanalytical
people, yet it had a certain deprecating twist
which could convey a hint of subtlety.</p>

<p>When the seven o’clock whistle blew, Loring
thought of the gang at the road camp lined up
for ten hours of relentless toil, and he breathed
deep in contentment.</p>

<p>“It is great to be laid up for a respectable
cause,” he thought. Memories of the times that
he had spent at an old university in the East
came to him. He looked about him at the rough,
bare boards, at the eight canvas cots, at the lumps
on three of them, where, wearing the inevitable
pink or sky blue undershirt, lay sick Mexican
miners. He amused himself by mentally filling
with his old-time associates each of the empty
cots. “I wish they were all here,” he half exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Then it occurred to him that this was
not a very kindly wish. Loring heard the murmur
of voices outside the door, and listened attentively.
He recognized the voice of the company
doctor. “It must be time for the morning clinic,”
he thought to himself. Then he listened to the
brisk questioning and prescribing.</p>

<p>“You feeling much <i lang="es">mal’</i>? Well, not so much
whisky next time; get to work!”</p>

<p>Stephen heard a low-voiced question from
some one. Then again the doctor’s decided answer:
“Of course not! Hospital fee does not
pay for crutches. What do you want for a dollar,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>He listened with interest as each man described
his symptoms or his needs. “It makes
me feel almost well to hear about all those things,”
he reflected. The broad shoulders and cheerful
smile of the doctor appeared in the doorway,
and with heavy footsteps the owner of these
two pleasant possessions approached Loring.</p>

<p>“Feeling pretty good this morning?” asked
the doctor.</p>

<p>Stephen answered that he was.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” exclaimed the doctor. “At
one time you were a pretty tough case. I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
we’d have the trouble of a funeral in camp.
Swell affairs they are, here. But say, did you
ever see a funeral in Phœnix? Why, they <em>trots</em>
’em in Phœnix!”</p>

<p>Loring expressed his admiration for such a
spirit of activity, while the doctor was propping
him up in bed, and adjusting the bandages.</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t have to work for some
days,” remarked the doctor. “It is lucky you
did one day’s work, as it just pays for your hospital
fee and medicine.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck, doctor,” laughed Stephen, “but
that had to go for traveling expenses.” Hearing
light footsteps on the porch outside, the doctor
went to the door. Loring heard him answer
some question.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Cameron, I guess it won’t kill him
to see you. It may even be good for him. Come
in by all means!”</p>

<p>Loring looked up and saw framed in the doorway,
like a picture, a girl frank of eyes and fresh
of coloring. A little Scotch cap was perched on
the waves of her tawny hair. Her gown was of
dark blue, relieved at neck and throat by bands
of white, and girdled by a ribbon of red and blue
plaid. Across her arms lay a sheaf of yellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
red wild flowers such as creep into abundant life
among the forbidding rocks. The vision seemed
to bring a new tide of life and vigor to Loring.
He forgot his weakness and raised himself for a
moment on his elbow; but the effort was too
much for him, and he sank back exhausted on
his pillow.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated for an instant. Then she
stepped quickly over to his cot.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Cameron, Loring,” explained
the doctor; “she has come to thank you for what
you have done.”</p>

<p>The girl impulsively bent over him, and took
his big, weak hand in her own small, strong one.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad that you are better. I would
have come before to see you, but the doctor
would not allow it.”</p>

<p>Loring looked malevolently at the doctor.</p>

<p>“How can I thank you?” she went on.</p>

<p>So fascinated was Stephen by the eager breathless
way in which she spoke, that he hardly
understood what she was saying. With difficulty
he raised himself again on his elbow. “Why it
was all in the day’s work of a flagman,” he said.
“There is nothing at all for which to thank me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head in denial. “It is not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
day’s work of a flagman to risk his life for someone
whom he has never seen,” she said quickly.
“There is nothing that I can say which can
possibly express my gratitude; but you do know,
don’t you?” As she spoke she looked at him
appealingly.</p>

<p>Stephen murmured something, he scarcely knew
what, in reply, and was conscious of wishing
vaguely that the doctor would not look at him.</p>

<p>Miss Cameron laid her armful of flowers beside
him. As she dropped the red and yellow sheaf,
Stephen noticed the delicate modeling of her wrist,
and smiled appreciatively. “When you are better,
my father will see you,” continued the girl. “He
will reward you, and—” With her usual quick
intuition she noticed the shade of annoyance on
his face. “That is,” she went on rather slowly,
“he will do what he can for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Loring, “but I think that
in two or three weeks I shall be able to work
again.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid if I let you talk any more, you
won’t ever be able to work,” interrupted the
doctor.</p>

<p>“I will come again to-morrow,” said Jean.
“If there is anything that you want, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
let us send it to you. Good-bye, and thank you!”
Her voice as she spoke had the quality of sympathy.</p>

<p>He watched her for a moment as she stopped
by the other cots, inquiring in pretty broken
Spanish for the welfare of the occupants. “Hang
it,” he thought, “I wish she would not look at
that Mexican in just the way that she looked at
me!” With his eyes he followed her as long as
he could, then when the tents shut her from view,
he closed his eyes and imagined that she was still
near.</p>

<p>He picked up the flowers and buried his face
in them. Their sweetness brought up a wave of
memories of the past, of things that he had thrown
away. He bit his lip hard and under his breath
swore bitterly at himself. Then the fragrance
of the flowers soothed him, and he lay back on
his pillow thinking of the girl who had brought
them. She seemed so strange a figure in the life
of Quentin, so aloof, so unrelated! He could not
adjust her to her setting. At last it occurred to
him that it was not necessary for him to adjust
her—in fact that she and her setting were none
of his business.</p>

<p>Then tired, with the flowers still crushed in
his hand, he fell asleep to the accompaniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the monotonous pound of the smelter. He
dreamed of days gone by, yet through it all,
vaguely, intangibly, there drifted a girl, the tenderness
of whose eyes was blended with the impersonality
of pity.</p>

<p>As they walked together across the camp, Miss
Cameron remarked to the doctor: “It is strange
how the rough life here seems to train men. He
seemed to be almost a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Doctor Kline smiled in an amused fashion.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot here, Miss Cameron, who seem
‘almost a gentleman,’ and they are not the best
kind, either. In fact they come pretty near to
being the worst. Arizona is not the graveyard
of reputations. It’s the hell that comes after
that. Men drift here from every corner of the
world, and from every sort of life. The undercurrent
here is full of derelicts. Nobody questions
about the past or the future here. They
just drift, and it is not so very long before most
of them sink.”</p>

<p>In the course of forty years of varied experience,
Dr. Kline had never made so long a speech. He
stopped short, and, flushing, looked quickly at
Miss Cameron to see if she were laughing at him.
Her serious expression reassured him, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
looked at her again; only this time it was for the
purpose of admiration.</p>

<p>They had reached the door of her father’s
house. It was called a house and not a shack,
partly as a matter of etiquette, being the manager’s
dwelling, and partly because it had a porch.
Also it possessed the added grandeur of two small
wings, which were joined to the one-story, central
building.</p>

<p>Jean said good-bye to the doctor and went into
the house. Her father was busy at his desk with
some large blue prints of the workings; but he
stopped when she entered.</p>

<p>“How is the man getting along?” he asked.
“I hope that the poor devil isn’t laid up so that
he can never swing a pick again.”</p>

<p>“He is much better,” answered Jean, as she
dropped into a big chair beside her father’s desk,
“but, Father, do these men do nothing else all
their lives beside swing picks?”</p>

<p>Her father smiled, amused at the earnest
manner. “Well, my dear, they are likely to do
so, unless they develop aptitude for ‘polishing’
the head of a drill, as they say here. In other
words, become miners, instead of ‘muckers,’ in
which case they get their three dollars a day instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of two. The difference in social position,
however, which I suppose is what you mean, is
not very great.”</p>

<p>“I thought that the West was a place where
men rose fast from the ranks, where the opportunities
for success lay at each man’s feet,” said
Jean thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That is partially true,” replied her father;
“but you must remember steadiness is needed
as much here as anywhere, and that is a quality
which most men, of a type such as I judge this
Loring to be, have not. Also to reach success
here they have to swim through a river of whisky,
and most of them drown in transit.”</p>

<p>Jean sat for a moment in silence, the sun playing
tricks of light and shade across the ripples of
her hair and in the depths of her level-gazing
eyes.</p>

<p>At length she exclaimed suddenly: “Why is it
that they all drink?”</p>

<p>“Why?” echoed her father. “I have been so
occupied with the result that I have had no time
to consider the cause. The fact is—they have
no other form of relaxation here. Besides, when
men work seven days a week all the year round,
after a while they reach a point where they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
do something to break the tedium, and drinking
whisky is a convenient method.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you make them work on Sunday?”
asked Jean. “Why not let them rest
on that day?”</p>

<p>Her father laughed. “Well, it doesn’t sound
logical after what I have just said, but if they
get Sunday to rest, they are all so drunk that we
have not enough men on Monday to start the
mines. We tried it once. I suppose that the
only explanation of the way the men drink here
is that they do. I think it is a germ in the air.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron turned again to his work.
Jean sat silently beside him watching the firm
lines with which he traced new winzes, drifts,
and cross-cuts on the prints, the precision with
which he wrote his comments on the borders.</p>

<p>It was a strong face which bent over the table,
strong, stern, and telling of a Scotch ancestry
in which Mr. Cameron took great pride, for
had not one of his forefathers fought in the
army of the Lord of the Isles, and another been
a faithful follower to the end of the hopeless
Stuart cause!</p>

<p>Clearly loyalty was a tradition of their race,
and typical of that allegiance which still made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
all Scotch things dear to these two descendants
of the old Highlanders, which led the father to
hang on the bare walls of his cabin the shield
of the Camerons with its armorial bearings of
“or, three bars gules,” and impelled Jean to
wear a Scotch cap, and always, somewhere
about her dress, a touch of the red and blue
Cameron plaid.</p>

<p>Now, as Jean stood at her father’s side, it was
easy to see the family likeness, for all the softening
of age and sex, which had changed the
lines of his face to the curves of hers. The
same spirit looked out from both pairs of eyes,
and if ever there should come a conflict of
wills between the two, there would be as pretty
a fight as once happened at Inverlochie, when
Cameron and the Lord Protector fell foul of
each other.</p>

<p>Jean Cameron had been only a month in
Quentin. She had begged to join her father and
he had consented, although he had assured her
that she would dislike the life. But from the
first she had loved the place and everything
about it. The atmosphere of crude labor, the
men thrusting down into the mountains and
drawing out the green-crusted ore, the rides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
across the trails, had brought her a sense of
exhilaration.</p>

<p>She had expected to find in the West the
romance of freedom, of wildness, of the natural
type. Instead, she had found, and it was infinitely
more fascinating, the romance of work,
of risk borne daily as a matter of course, not
from love of danger, but because it meant bread.
To a girl of her keen perception there was a
meaning in it all. It was the first glimpse that
she had ever had of a world where the little
things of life had no existence and where the
big things were the little things.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>During his convalescence, Stephen had
many callers. Mr. Cameron paid him
a short visit, and briskly and efficiently
expressed his gratitude. At least this was the
way in which Loring characterized it to himself,
after his departure. From motives of kindness,
most of the foremen and men from the office
force came in to see him; from motives of self-interest,
the visits were generally repeated, for
Loring combined a drollness, a vein of narrative,
and a wide range of experiences.</p>

<p>McKay was one of those who dropped in
frequently to discuss the affairs of the camp in
short, jerky sentences, which alternated with the
puffs from his stubby black pipe. Stephen, by a
great amount of reticence as to his own personal
affairs, had won McKay’s respect as a wise man.
He was by nature of an exuberant temperament;
but experience had taught him that taciturnity
was the best way to acquire a reputation for
solidity in a community. About four years previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to this time, when he had embarked in
life in the West, the first man under whom he
had worked had commented upon his garrulous
propensities rather caustically. His words:
“You don’t want to talk too much in this world,
young feller; it ain’t pleasant,” had been borne
in upon Loring to the great improvement of
his character. McKay had once in the course
of a discussion of different men’s capabilities
expressed the Western view very tersely. He
had said: “The wisest man I ever knew was a
fellow in Nogales. I never heard him open his
mouth once!”</p>

<p>Loring’s visitors, however, were not all of
such a character. Every morning Miss Cameron
came into the hospital and greeted Stephen
with a gay smile that made pain seem a base
currency with which to pay for such happiness.
He had come to look forward to the few minutes
during which she talked to him as the oasis
of his day. As time went on, his thoughts of her
grew more absorbing. A man when convalescent
can, with the greatest of ease, fall in love with
an abstract ideal, so that when a very charming
concrete example was near, the process of dreaming
speedily crystallized to a point where Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
found himself very much in love. For many
hours after one of her visits he lay staring at the
ceiling, trying to find some adjective by which to
describe her. Failing in his direct search, he
fell back on the method of question and answer.
Was she beautiful? he asked himself. It was
many years since he had seen women of her class,
and it was hard for him to find a comparative
standard. He was certain that she was a joy to
look upon. Had she sympathy? Her kindness
to the sick Mexicans in the hospital was a ready
answer to that question. Was she feminine?
She had a quality of comradeship and companionship
combined, which previously he had only
associated with men. Yet back of it was a latent
coquetry, and unconsciously it piqued him to feel
that towards him there was no trace of it. Strive
as he would, he could find no word which could
fit all the opposing sides of her character, her
aloof frankness, her subtle force.</p>

<p>“Fall-in-love-withable-ness,” he reflected, “is
not a recognized word, and yet it is the one
that describes her.”</p>

<p>At last came the days when with effort at
first, then with ease, he could stroll from shack
to shack about the camp. He often spent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
time in the assay office, watching the assayer
tend the delicate balances, or precipitate the
metal from the various shades of blue liquid
which stood on the ledge by the window in neat
rows of test-tubes. Then there was the <i lang="es">tienda</i>,
where, sitting on a box in the corner, he could
watch the Mexicans as they crowded up to the
bookkeeper’s window, loudly calling out their
numbers, and asking for coupons. The air in
the store was always thick with the smell of
“<i lang="es">Ricorte</i>” or “<i lang="es">Pedro</i>” tobacco. There were
also in the glass cases gaudy tinfoil-wrapped
cigars, “<i lang="es">Dos Nationes</i>,” which the more lavish
and wealthy purchased, and which added a
slightly more expensive hue to the smoky atmosphere.
Often, too, he would loaf about the
draughting-room, where at first he amused himself
by drawing exceedingly impressionistic
sketches on the bits of paper that were scattered
about.</p>

<p>Stephen possessed that rare quality of being
able to loaf without being in the way. His loafing
added a pleasant background to work that
others were doing, instead of being an irritant.
Gradually he came to helping Duncan, the surveyor,
to check up his figures, and, much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
latter’s surprise, in speedy fashion worked out
logarithms for him. Loring as a subordinate always
did so well that it made his incompetency,
when given responsibility, doubly disappointing.
Duncan, whose mathematical methods
were, though no doubt safer, far slower, grew
to have an excessive opinion of Loring’s ability,
and expressed it about the camp. He often
questioned Stephen as to where he had acquired
his knowledge of logarithms; but Loring always
told him that he had merely picked it up at a
way station on the journey of life. As curiosity
about others rarely goes deep in Arizona, the
subject had been finally taken for granted, and
dropped.</p>

<p>One day while Stephen was working with
Duncan, Mr. Cameron entered the room, and
said abruptly: “Well, Loring, are you about
ready for work?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Stephen, “I was going to work
for Mr. McKay again to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron paused for a moment, and
looked him over carefully. He noticed the clear
light of the eyes, and he was pleased. He noticed
the indecisive lines at the corners of the
mouth, hesitated, and almost imperceptibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
shook his head. Years of experience had taught
him to read men’s faces well. This was the first
which he had ever liked, and yet not quite
trusted. The combination of feeling puzzled
him.</p>

<p>Loring had begun to flush a trifle under the
sharp scrutiny, before Mr. Cameron again
spoke.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of giving you a position on
the hoist. The man on Number Three is going
to quit to-morrow.” Mr. Cameron said “quit,”
with a little snap of the jaw, that left no doubt
as to why the man was going to leave. “Do
you know anything about the work?” he
went on.</p>

<p>Loring’s “No, but I think perhaps I can
learn,” seemed to irritate Mr. Cameron, who
exclaimed: “Good Lord, man! ‘think perhaps
you may be able to learn.’ ‘Think perhaps!’
Here you are going to have men’s lives
in your hands. It is no place for a man who
thinks ‘perhaps.’ Still I will try you. You will
receive three dollars and a half for eight hours,
and overtime, extra. At that the work is not
hard. You can go up to the shaft now. Colson,
the man whom you are going to try to replace, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
on shift, and he will teach you what he can.
You go on the pay-roll to-morrow.” Cutting
short Stephen’s thanks, Mr. Cameron abruptly
left the office.</p>

<p>Duncan began to chuckle quietly.</p>

<p>“It is damned lucky for you, Loring, that you
didn’t go on much further with your theories
of ‘thinking perhaps.’ I don’t know where
you were before you came here, and I don’t care;
but here it will help you some to remember that
it is only what you <em>do</em> know or <em>can</em> do that
counts.”</p>

<p>Stephen took cheerfully this good advice, and
after securing his hat, he stretched himself comfortably
in the doorway, then started up the
hill to the mine. In the hot glare he climbed the
tramway which led from the hungry ore cribs by
the smelter to Number Three hoist. He was
still weak, and the climb tired him considerably.
Several times, in the course of the few
hundred yards, he stopped and rested. As
many times more he was compelled to step to one
side of the track in order to let the funny, squat,
little ore cars whiz by him, the brake cable behind
them stretching taut, and whining with the
peculiar note of metal under tension. When at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
last, tired and out of breath, he reached the
hoist box, Colson gave him a sour greeting.</p>

<p>“Damned boiler leaks like a sieve. Have to
keep stoking her all the time. Engine is always
getting centered. Wish you joy! It’s the worst
job I ever tackled.”</p>

<p>In answer to Loring’s request for instructions,
Colson slowly wiped his hands on a bit of oily
waste, and having taken a fresh chew of tobacco,
proceeded to explain the working of the drum
hoist, and the signal code.</p>

<p>For the rest of the afternoon, under Colson’s
supervision, Stephen managed the clutch that
governed the cable, and at the ever recurring
clang of one bell, ran the ore buckets with great
speed up the shaft. Whenever the signal of
three bells, followed by one, rang out, he brought
the buckets slowly and decorously to the surface,
for that told of a human load. Loring, in
spite of apparent clumsiness, possessed a great
amount of deftness, and he was soon running the
hoist fairly well, although the jerks with which
the engine was brought to a standstill told the
miners that a new and inexperienced hand was at
the clutch.</p>

<p>At half-past three the men of the shift began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to signal to come to the surface. Loring asked
Colson how, when the shift did not end till four,
this was allowed. Colson explained that as the
mine was non-Union, and employed mostly
Mexican labor, the piece work system was in
use. When the men had filled a certain number
of buckets, they could come to the surface regardless
of the time. The result had been that
more work was accomplished than formerly,
while the miners had shorter hours.</p>

<p>“That is all very pleasant,” reflected Stephen,
“if the company, having seen how active the
men can be, does not increase the number of
buckets required.”</p>

<p>Shortly before four o’clock they were relieved
by the engineer for the next shift, who undertook
the task of lowering the waiting men. Then
Colson and Loring, picking up their coats,
walked slowly down the hill into the camp.
At the smelter Loring parted with Colson and
walked over to his own quarters. Since his
dismissal from the hospital, he had been sharing
a tent with one of the shift bosses—a man
about whom Stephen knew little except the fact
that he was named Lynn, and that he never
washed. The company rented tents with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
board floors, for two dollars a month, so that
when the quarters were shared, household expenses
were not large.</p>

<p>As Loring threw back the wire-screened door
of the tent, Lynn, from within, greeted him with
mild interest.</p>

<p>“I hear they are goin’ to try you on Number
Three. Now over where I used to work in Black
Eagle, they wouldn’t let a green man even smell
the hoist. It ain’t safe, nor legal. But I suppose
the Boss had to give you <em>some</em> job. All
wrong, though.”</p>

<p>Loring kept discreet silence in answer to this,
and after fetching a bucket of water, proceeded
to wash with many splashes. This annoyed
Lynn, who grunted: “How can a man do any
work with you wallowin’ round like a herd of
steers?” Then he returned to his previous occupation
of poring over location papers for some
claims of his “up yonder.” These claims were
the joke of the camp, on account of their remoteness
from any known ore vein, yet Lynn, unaffected
by the waves of exultation or depression
which from time to time swept through the camp,
year by year persisted in doggedly doing his assessment
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>In Arizona almost every man, no matter what
his occupation or station, has “some claims up
in the hills.” These claims furnish the romance
of his life, for always beneath the grimmest
present lies the golden “perhaps” of a rich
strike.</p>

<p>Stephen sat on the edge of his cot, rolling a
cigarette and watching Lynn’s profile.</p>

<p>“There are some people,” he meditated,
“who would not look cheerful if they were paid
so much a smile.” When Lynn had finished his
papers, he rose with solemn deliberative slowness,
took down a black felt hat from a wooden
peg on the tent pole, transferred his toothpick
from the left side of his mouth to the right, and
slouched towards the door.</p>

<p>“Come on over to grub!” he called back.
Loring joined him, and together they walked
over to the company mess.</p>

<p>As they picked their way along the sordid
road, Stephen looked at the dirty houses of the
Mexicans with a feeling of repulsion. They
were built from all the refuse that could be
gathered: old sheet iron, quilts, suwara rods, a
few boards, broken pieces of glass and tarred
paper. A broken-down wagon, on one wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
lurching in a dissipated fashion against a boulder,
added to the disreputability of the tin-can-strewn
road. While he and Lynn were plodding
moodily along, Stephen suddenly heard behind
him the clatter of horses’ hoofs. He turned.
The scene no longer seemed sordid, for riding
up the road was Miss Cameron. Around her
rode five or six little girls,—the camp children,—their
legs, too short to reach the stirrups,
stuck in the leathers, their hair flying in all
directions, while their stiff little gingham dresses
fluttered in the breeze. Jean, riding a gray pony,
sat clean limbed and lithe across the saddle.
The deep full modeling of breast and thigh, the
proud carriage of the shoulders, and the easy
swing of her body to the lope of the horse—all
bespoke high health and keen enjoyment. Her
khaki skirt fell on either side in yellow folds
against the oiled brown of the saddle. She
wore no hat, and the sunlight struck clear and
sparkling upon her tawny hair. Her color was
fresh from the sting of the wind.</p>

<p>Stephen stepped aside to let the little cavalcade
pass; but Miss Cameron reined in her pony,
and smilingly greeted him and his companion.
Her convoy of little girls bade her a grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
“good-bye,” and scattered to their homes in the
various parts of the camp.</p>

<p>“You seem to be a ‘Pied Piper of Hamelin,’”
remarked Stephen, looking up at her. Lynn
for some reason appeared uneasy.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t decoy them,” she answered. “In
fact, I try hard to get away from them, but they
are not allowed to ride alone in the valley, and
consequently whenever they see my pony saddled
they swarm about me like bees and cannot
be shaken off. Are you sure that you are strong
enough to be out of the hospital?” Miss Cameron
added, scrutinizing Stephen with friendly
solicitude.</p>

<p>Loring was busying himself with the problem
of whether her eyes were really gray or blue.
He gathered his wits together however to answer
that he was growing better steadily.</p>

<p>“Well, good night, and be sure to continue to
get better!” The girl shook the reins of her
pony, and galloped off towards the corral.</p>

<p>Lynn could no longer contain himself.</p>

<p>“Look a-here, Loring. I don’t know where
you was brought up, but Miss Cameron is a lady,
if ever I seed one, and whar I come from, gentlemen
don’t call ladies ‘Pi-eyed Pipers.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen, with a start, came out of his wistful
mood, then almost collapsed with laughter.
Lynn stalked along in silent wrath, not speaking
another word until they entered the mess
room.</p>

<p>It was half-past five, and the room was still
crowded, though that many had come and gone
was attested by the pools of coffee on the zinc
tables, the bread crumbs on the floor, and the
great piles of dirty dishes. In a mining camp
five o’clock is the fashionable supper hour, and
he who comes late has cause to rue it. Loring
and his companion cleared places for themselves,
and after the necessary preliminaries of wiping
their cracked plates on their sleeves, and obtaining
their share from the great bowl of stew in the
center of the table, they proceeded to eat in
businesslike silence. There had been a time
when such surroundings would have taken away
Stephen’s appetite, but that was far away.
The proprietor walked frequently up and down
the room, answering mildly the contumely
heaped upon the food. He carried a large bucket
from which he replenished the coffee cups.
Stephen quickly reached the dessert stage of the
meal, and the proprietor set that course before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him. It consisted of two very shiny canned
peaches, floating in a dubious juice.</p>

<p>The man who owned the eating house was of
a quiet, depressed nature developed by years of
endeavor to please boarders’ appetites at one dollar
a day and make a profit of seventy-five cents.
Ordinarily dessert consisted of one canned peach.
Loring’s double allowance was a silent tribute to
the fact that he did not rail at the food as did the
others, and to the fact that once, when the purveyor
had “spread himself” and served canned
oysters, Stephen had thanked him. This had
been the third time that the man had been
thanked in all his life, and he stowed it away
in his strange placid brain.</p>

<p>When Stephen had finished his meal, he rose
and joined the group of men, who, as customary
after supper, were lounging on the steps. The
proprietor, wearing his usual apologetic smile,
soon joined them.</p>

<p>“Pretty good supper, boys?” he remarked
tentatively.</p>

<p>Some one in the crowd moaned drearily.
“Say, I know what good food is. I used to eat
up at the Needles, at a place so swell they give
Mexicans pie. Reg’lar sort of Harvey house, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was.” The proprietor, still smiling, sadly withdrew,
and the crowd returned to its former occupations:
commenting on the thin ponies of
the Mexicans who galloped by, and trying to
catch the eyes of the señoritas as they strolled
past, arm in arm, seemingly stolid alike to the
attentions and to the jests of the men.</p>

<p>Many of the Indians, who had been brought
from the San Carlos Reservation to work on the
railway grade, were in camp to make their simple
purchases of supplies. Stephen noticed with
disgust the way the braves sat astride their ponies
with indolent grace, while beside them walked
the squaws, with the papooses slung in blankets
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good example of the ‘noble redman,’ isn’t
it!” he exclaimed to McKay.</p>

<p>“Well, what can you expect?” chuckled the
latter. “You know in their marriage ceremony
the brave puts the bit of his pony in the mouth of
his prospective bride. Sort of a symbol of equality
and companionship between man and wife,
I reckon.”</p>

<p>As the twilight turned to dusk, the group
gradually dissolved, till Loring alone was left
on the steps. It was peaceful there, and as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
drew on his old black pipe, a healthy feeling of
contentment permeated him. He felt that he
could do his new work well. His last lessons, he
thought, had taught him concentration. He
saw himself working up again to a position of
power. For some reason that even to himself
was only vaguely defined, he felt that now it was
all infinitely worth while. As for drink, he
merely thought of it as an episode of the past.
Stephen’s worst fault lay in not grappling with his
enemies until they had him by the throat. As he
sat smoking and dreaming, he was aroused by a
cheerful salutation.</p>

<p>“Howdy, me bludder? Me bludder, he feel
fine?”</p>

<p>Stephen looked up to see Hop Wah standing
in the road before him. With his derby hat,
yellow face, coal black pig-tail, and with a
five-cent cigar drooping from one corner of his
mouth Wah was a strange combination of Occident
and Orient.</p>

<p>“Fine, thanks!” answered Loring, “but what
are you doing up here in camp now, Wah?”</p>

<p>Wah proudly puffed at his cigar, and blew a
wreath of gray smoke from between his flat lips.</p>

<p>“Me cook for the company here, now. Makee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pie ebbrey day. Oh, lubbly, lubbly pie! Me
bludder come to back door, and I give him some.
Oh, lubbly, lubbly pie! Goodee bye. Goodee
bye, me bludder!” Then Wah departed in the
direction of the <i lang="es">tienda</i>, marching cheerfully
along to his old refrain: “La, la, boom, boom;
la, la, boom, boom.”</p>

<p>“The crazy Chinaman!” laughed Stephen.
“He certainly enjoys life, though.” Loring rose
and knocked out the ashes of his pipe on the
steps. Then he walked towards his tent. They
were just dumping the slag from the smelter, and
he watched the glowing slag pot shoot along the
track in front of him. As if by magic it checked
at the end of the heap, and poured its molten,
flashing stream far over the embankment. The
whole camp glowed with a clear, all-suffusing
orange light. The outline of the surrounding
mountains loomed out blue-black. The glow
faded to dull red, then dwindled to a mere
thread of light, then disappeared, and all was
dark again.</p>

<p>During the next two months, with a concentration
of which he had never before thought himself
capable, Stephen slaved at learning his task.
To feel that in his hands lay the lives of the sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
men of the shift gave him a sense of responsibility,
which in all his former work had been
completely lacking. He was so faithful in the
performance of his duties that even the critical
Mr. Cameron was secretly pleased, while Jean
watched with growing interest her father’s experiment,
and felt that at last Loring had ceased
to drift.</p>

<p>Stephen, on his part, carried in his heart one
memory which shortened his working day, gladdened
his leisure hours, and left no time for vain
regrets. This was the thought of one evening
which he had spent at Mr. Cameron’s house, on
the occasion of a “Gringo” dance, whereto all
the workers in camp, except the Mexicans, had
been bidden, in celebration of Washington’s
birthday.</p>

<p>Often did Stephen recall the flag-draped room,
the Mexican orchestra, which in color resembled
a slice of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice-cream.
He remembered the lantern-lighted porch,
its lamps blending with the soft darkness of the
southern night, hung with its own lanterns of
stars.</p>

<p>But all these were only a background of his
real memories, which were the warm touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Jean’s hand, as he had held it in the dance for
five blessed minutes, and the sound of her voice
as she had talked with him on the porch, in the
brief intervals when the guests had gathered
around the musicians, to invoke the “Star Spangled
Banner” and urge that long might it
“Wa-a-ave!”</p>

<p>What they had talked about Stephen scarcely
knew; but he had a confused impression that
under the commonplaces of their talk had lurked,
on her part, a hint of friendship which made his
dreams perhaps not quite so wild, for he recognized
in her something softly invincible which
once having given friendship would never withdraw
it, though the skies fell. In fact, while
Loring was playing cards over the mess
table one evening, Jean was putting her friendship
to the proof in another quarter of the
camp.</p>

<p>“Father, he is a gentleman.” Jean made this
remark after a period of silence, during which
she had sat on the porch of the shack, contemplating
the moon as it rode high in the unclouded
sky.</p>

<p>“Who is a gentleman? The man in the moon?”
As he asked the question, Mr. Cameron withdrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
his cigar from his mouth, and pulled the smoke in
leisurely rings into the air.</p>

<p>“No,” Jean answered, “not the man in the
moon; the man on the hoist, Stephen Loring.”</p>

<p>“What made you think of him?”</p>

<p>“I met him this afternoon in the valley. That
put him into my head.”</p>

<p>“Well, I advise you to take him out again.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I shall keep him there. He interests
me, because he is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“What are the hall-marks of a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jean slowly, “there are a hundred
little signs which cannot be suppressed. A
deacon may turn into a horse thief, or a millionaire
into a beggar; but once a gentleman,
always a gentleman. Mr. Loring tries to hide
it; but he cannot. Oh, haven’t you noticed
the difference?”</p>

<p>“Between Loring and the other men? No, I
cannot say that I have. But I am not particularly
interested in the question whether my hoist
engineers are gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you ought to be?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Jean clasped her hands around her knee and
looked out over the dim hills bathed in the mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the moonlight. After a while she said: “It
must be very lonely for a gentleman in a camp
like this.”</p>

<p>“If you are thinking of Loring,” said her father,
“he is busy all day and he can go to the mess in
the evening.”</p>

<p>“The mess!” exclaimed Jean scornfully. “Yes,
fine place for a gentleman, where the men chew
tobacco and drink whisky all the evening, and
tell stories as long as they are broad!”</p>

<p>“All terribly offensive no doubt to a sensitive
soul like your Mr. Loring,” answered Mr. Cameron.
“Perhaps,” he added with fine sarcasm,
“you would like to have him take his meals with
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would like to ask him here sometime.
It is good in you to think of it,” replied his daughter
calmly.</p>

<p>“It cannot be done, Jean. It cannot be done,”
Mr. Cameron said with decision. “Discrimination
among the men breeds discontent. I think
that we have done full enough for Loring as it is.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” Jean responded, with the audacity
of a hot temper. “Well, I do not; but then it
was my life that he saved, and perhaps that makes
me see the thing differently. I am thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
when a man saves your life you cannot get rid
of the obligation by throwing him a job, as you
might toss a bone to a dog. I am thinking that
he has some claim on the life that he has given
back, and that the other person should spend a
little of it in doing something for him.”</p>

<p>“And, pray, what has his being a gentleman to
do with all this?” asked Mr. Cameron, whose
wrath took the form of sarcasm. “Suppose that
Colson or Lynn had saved your life, would you
have wished to have him at the house?”</p>

<p>“Neither of them would have wished to
come.”</p>

<p>“That is not honest, Jean. You know that
they would; but you would never ask them,
except to one of your camp dances. You would
not if they had saved your life twenty times.”</p>

<p>“I should try to do something for them, something
that they would like; but if people are not
of your kind there is no use in inviting them.
There is no kindness in it in the end.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said her father, “there would prove
to be no kindness in the end in what you wish to
do for Loring.”</p>

<p>“Very well. There is no use in arguing with a
Scotchman; but I warn you that I shall make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
up to him in friendliness. The other men can
scarcely object to that.”</p>

<p>With these words Jean rose from the steps and,
passing through the door, entered the little living-room
where she picked up a guitar from the
window-seat, and to its accompaniment began to
sing in a low voice. What was the song she
chose? Why, it was “Jock o’ Hazeldean.” If
ever a song expressed flat mutiny it is that one,
and it lost nothing in expression from Jean
Cameron’s rendering, from the beginning where
the heroine refuses to be commanded or cajoled,
to the last line where “She’s o’er the border and
awa’ wi’ Jock o’ Hazeldean.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron was justified in being angry;
but who could resist a voice like Jean Cameron’s?
Evidently not Jean’s father, for when the girl
came out again and smiling laid her hand upon
his shoulder, Mr. Cameron relaxed the grimness
of his expression.</p>

<p>“Well, well, lassie, we will see what can be done
for your gentleman engineer,” he said encouragingly;
“but don’t be ‘o’er the border and awa’’
with Jock, till we know a little more about him,
and about what is thought of him in Hazeldean.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>“Oh, Loring. Have you heard the news?”
Stephen, on his way to breakfast, on
the morning of the Fourth of July,
stopped until McKay joined him.</p>

<p>“No. What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“There is to be a half holiday to-day,” went
on McKay.</p>

<p>“The devil there is! I did not know that such
things existed this side of heaven.”</p>

<p>“In which case you would never see one,”
laughed McKay. “But to-day there is to be one.
In my opinion, we owe it to Miss Cameron’s influence
with her father. Every one can knock
off work at twelve o’clock. Look at the notice!”</p>

<p>On the office wall, beneath the usual “<i lang="es">No
Entrada—Oficina</i>,” was a big placard which conveyed
the news in English and Spanish. Stephen
read it with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I think that will make breakfast taste rather
well. What is your opinion, Mac?”</p>

<p>“That comes pretty close to my jedgments,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
answered McKay. “Hey, Wah, you crazy Chinaman;
quit hammering that gong!”</p>

<p>This last was addressed to Hop Wah, who was
standing on the porch of the eating house, hammering
with a railroad spike upon an iron gong.</p>

<p>“Me hab to. Else me lazy pig bludders allee
late. La, la, boom, boom! Breakfas’. Nice hot
cakes. Oh, lubbly, lubbly cakes; eggs this mornin’.
Goodee canned eggs. Oh, lubbly; la, la”—Wah
fled precipitately into the kitchen, as Loring
and McKay made gestures of killing him.</p>

<p>They were the first at the mess, and while the
sleepy stragglers filed in, one by one, they ate
their oatmeal in comfort. They took a lazy
pleasure in watching the surprise, and listening
to the ejaculations, with which the news of the
half holiday was received. “Thin Jim,” who
always presided at the head of the table, on account
of his so-called “boarding house arm,”
which enabled him to be of vast service as a waiter,
professed to be so astounded at the news as to be
incapable of performing his duties.</p>

<p>“What with a dance on Washington’s birthday,
and a half holiday to-day, why, we’re becomin’
sort of a leisure class,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, look out that you don’t deteriorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
under the strain,” laughed Loring. “Has any
one a match?” The only real system in all Loring’s
habits of life was his custom of rising early
enough to have time for a smoke between breakfast
and work.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the camp was alive with shouts
and hilarity. On the slag dump two baseball
games were in progress, of such excitement that
the umpires had early withdrawn; while some
one had established in the gulch an impromptu
shooting gallery, whence the quick rattle of reports
told of financial success.</p>

<p>Stephen sat with Duncan on the steps of the
assay office while the latter checked up his figures
for the morning’s work.</p>

<p>“The ore from Number Three is running six
per cent these days,” he exclaimed, as he tossed
his note-book into the office.</p>

<p>Together they watched the trail leading out
from the camp, down which rode little groups of
horsemen, lounging in the saddle. The smoke
from their cigarettes trailed thinly blue behind
them.</p>

<p>“There goes domesticity for you, Steve!” said
Duncan. He pointed to a family group riding
by. Old Tom Jenkins, the smelter boss, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
his wife, was starting for a trip to the river. Three
children were strung in various attitudes across
their saddles.</p>

<p>“It seems as if every one were going for a
ride,” commented Stephen. “Shall we fall in
line with the popular amusement?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got a horse,” answered Duncan,
“and all the company <i lang="es">caballos</i> will be out to-day.
I heard old Hodges down at the corral after
lunch cursing like a pirate at the amount of
saddling that he had to do. Right in the midst
of his growling, Miss Cameron came along, and
wanted a horse. The old man pretty nearly fell
over himself trying to accommodate her. There’s
something about her that seems to affect people
that way. Quite a convenient trait, I should
think!”</p>

<p>Stephen agreed silently, and in his mind added
considerably more, then strode off to the corral
for his pony.</p>

<p>As he slung the saddle across his horse’s back
and cinched the girth, he fumbled a little, for
his mind was not upon the task, but upon a certain
curl, which defying combs or hairpins, waved
capriciously at the turn of a girl’s neck.</p>

<p>Horses, however, have little sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sentiment, and while Loring tugged absent-mindedly
at the straps, the little beast puffed
and squealed, trying to arrange for a comfortable
space between his round, gray belly and the
girth. Stephen, placing his left hand on the head-piece,
and his right on the pommel, swung himself
into the saddle, in spite of the pony’s antics.
Soon he was loping out of camp, and down towards
the river. The clear sunshine struck his neck
beneath his broad hat; the alkali dust tasted
smoky and almost invigorating.</p>

<p>As he left the camp behind him, he laughed
and sang softly to himself, beating with his unspurred
heel the time of his song against his
pony’s ribs. He blessed the extravagance which
had led him to invest half a month’s pay in “<i lang="es">Muy
Bueno</i>,” as the horse was christened to indicate
the owner’s assurance that he was “very fine.”
Leaning forward, Loring playfully pulled “<i lang="es">Muy
Bueno’s</i>” ears. The pony shook its head in annoyance.
This was no holiday for him.</p>

<p>After a short distance the ground began to rise,
and the pony, with lowered head, buckled to his
task, resolutely attacking the trail which zig-zagged
up the steep mountainside.</p>

<p>Half way up the rise stood a saloon. As Loring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
approached it, he heard roars of laughter. In it
there was that quality which only liquor can produce.
As he drew nearer he could see the reason
for the laughter. Before the saloon was a girl
on horseback, her pony balking, and flatly refusing
to proceed. The doorway was full of half
drunken miners, calling out advice of varied import.
The saloon keeper, himself a bit flushed,
called out: “She’s got Tennessee Bob’s old pony.
He never would go by here without taking a
drink, and I reckon the horse sort of inherited
the habit.”</p>

<p>Stephen took in the situation at once. Riding
up quickly, he cut the stubborn pony across the
flank with his quirt. The animal quivered for
a moment, then as another stinging blow fell,
galloped on up the trail.</p>

<p>“Hell, Loring! what you want to do a thing
like that for? Funniest thing I’ve seen in a
month,” growled a man in the crowd.</p>

<p>Stephen only waved his hand in answer and
rode on after the girl, whom he had no difficulty
in recognizing. A couple of hundred yards
of hard riding brought him up with her.</p>

<p>Jean’s cheeks were still crimson, but it was as
much from laughter as embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Loring,” she exclaimed, half
breathlessly, “you seem to be always in the
position of a rescuer.”</p>

<p>“Your horses do seem to have a taste for adventure,”
he replied. “Perhaps I may be allowed
to accompany you on your ride this afternoon,”
continued Stephen. “There might, you know,
be other saloons which your pony was in the habit
of visiting.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be safer,” assented Jean.</p>

<p>They were nearing the crest of the hill, and the
trail broadened so that they could ride abreast.
A bevy of quail flushed suddenly up from the
ground, strumming the air sharply. A little
further on, a jack-rabbit jumped into the center
of the trail, looked about, then dove into the
underbrush. To a mind in its normal condition,
these things were but commonplaces. To Stephen
it seemed as if all nature were in an exuberant
mood. The very creak of the leather, or ring of
steel, as now and then one of the horses’ hoofs
struck on stone, fell in with the tenor of his
spirits. There are few men who could ride over
the Arizona hills with Jean Cameron and doubt
the gloriousness of existence.</p>

<p>At the summit they drew rein to breathe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
horses. Before them lay the valley of the “Dripping
Spring Wash.” For miles the belt of white
sand in the bottom stretched away darkened with
clumps of drab sage-brush, or with tall wavy lines
which they knew must be cactus. Whiter than
the sand, far out in the valley, a tent gleamed.
Here and there a few moving specks betokened
range cattle. Framing it all were great mountains,
as irregular and barren as floe ice,—blue,
purple, and brown, with streaks of yellow where
the hot rays of the sun struck upon bare earth.
All the detail of the rocky contour showed in the
clear air. The mountains at the end of the valley,
forty miles away, seemed as distinct as if within
a mile. In silence the riders sat their horses,
looking straight before them.</p>

<p>“I never knew how big life could be until I
saw Arizona,” exclaimed Jean.</p>

<p>“I never knew how big life could be until—”</p>

<p>“Until what, Mr. Loring?”</p>

<p>Loring’s answer was to guide the horses into
the trail that led down to the Wash.</p>

<p>In a short while they reached the bottom, and
rode out into the valley, where wandering “mavericks,”
or faggot-laden burros had pounded
innumerable hard paths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean shook the bridle of her horse, and calling
back over her shoulder, “Shall we run them?”
was off in a flash. Stephen, urging on his pony,
soon caught up with her, and side by side they
galloped hard up the valley. Leaning forward
in his saddle, he could watch the rich color rush
across the girl’s face, as the speed set her blood
dancing. Her head was tossed backward,
throwing out the clean molded chin, and perhaps
emphasizing the hint of obstinacy concealed
in its rounded finish. Her bridle hand
lay close on the horse’s neck, the small
gloved fingers crushing the reins. From the
amount of attention that Loring was, or
rather was not, paying to his horse, he richly
deserved a fall; but the fates spared him.
Perhaps they, too, were engaged in watching
the girl.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Jean pulled her horse down to
walk.</p>

<p>“That was splendid! Why can’t one always
be riding like that?”</p>

<p>Loring looked at her, amused by the exuberance
of her spirits.</p>

<p>“A bit hard on the horses as a perpetual thing,
otherwise perfect,” he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned to him suddenly. “Have you no
enthusiasms?”</p>

<p>“I used to have,” answered Stephen, “but
they were not of exactly the right kind. In fact
they made me what I am.”</p>

<p>“What are you?” she asked, looking at him
directly.</p>

<p>“A failure—and rather worse, because I am
a poor failure. There is just enough left in me
to make me realize the truth, but not enough to
compel me to do anything about it.”</p>

<p>Jean thought for a minute, then, with sincere
pity in her face, she asked, “Why?”</p>

<p>Stephen had resolved never to speak of his
past, of the golden opportunities lost, of the
friends who would have helped if they could;
but as he looked at her, at the slightly parted
lips, at the frank sympathy that shone from her
face, he knew that here was some one who
could understand and perhaps help.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, controlling the breaks in his
voice, then more evenly, he told her of start after
start, of the relatives who had disowned him, of
drifting and drifting. “Now, here I am, running
a hoist! Well, it is probably the best thing of
which I am capable and I owe it to you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
your father that I have so good a place. I have
been tried and found wanting in almost every
way the Lord could invent, and,” he tried
rather unsuccessfully to smile, “I think I am
down and out.”</p>

<p>Jean reached out her hand to him, and pressed
his warmly, with the proud confidence of not
being misunderstood.</p>

<p>“Mr. Loring, I do not believe it. You may
have been and done all that you say, but you
have still the battle ahead of you. I owe my life
to you. You risked yours to save me. I will
not let you go on throwing yourself away, without
trying to help you. I thank you for what
you have told me. I think that I understand.
It is hard perhaps for a girl to realize the truth;
but I do so want to help you! Here in Arizona
you have a fresh chance. Go on and win—and
never forget that I am going to stand by you.”</p>

<p>Stephen set his teeth and looked straight ahead
of him. Every nerve within him tingled with the
desire to bow his head over the small hand that
lay on his, to crave, he knew not what. Then
he lifted his head and looked at her. “I will
try—and God bless you!”</p>

<p>So absorbed had the man and girl been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their talk, that they had failed to realize that
the soft, swift night of Arizona was overtaking
them. Clouds too were gathering in the west
and obscuring the sunset before its time. Jean
noticed it at length and took alarm.</p>

<p>“We must turn and ride fast,” she said hastily.
“My father will be worried if we are late. I
think I remember this path which cuts into the
trail again farther on and is a shorter way. Let
us take it!”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Loring’s assent, she
dashed off to the left. Stephen followed her with
some misgiving. He had known too much of
the devious windings of these half-beaten paths
and would have chosen the longer way around in
confidence of its proving the shorter way home.</p>

<p>On and on they rode in the gathering darkness
till at length they could scarcely see a yard
ahead of them, and were forced to drop the reins
on the necks of the ponies, realizing that in such
a situation instinct is a far safer guide than
reason. Loring took the lead, and rode slowly
and cautiously, peering about him in the vain
hope of discovering the right way. At length
his pony balked suddenly and threw back its
ears. “Stop!” Stephen called back, as he slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
hastily from the saddle and took a step forward
to investigate the cause of “<i lang="es">Muy Bueno’s</i>”
fright. One step was enough, for it showed him
that the ground dropped off into space at his
very feet. “Whew!” he whistled softly to himself.
Then aloud he said: “I am afraid, Miss
Cameron, that you must dismount. Wait and
let me help you!” But before he could reach
her the girl was out of her saddle and at his side.
She saw their danger and paled at its nearness.
Then she said quietly: “Of course it is my
fault; but we need not talk about that now.
The question is, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“The only thing we can do is to grope our
way back by the way we have come, and hope by
good luck to reach the main trail again. If the
moon would only come up, we might at least get
our bearings,” said Loring.</p>

<p>“We ought to be somewhere near the Bingham
mine,” Jean reflected aloud. “Mr. Bingham
is a friend of my father’s and we have ridden
over to supper in his camp once or twice. But
I don’t know—I have lost all faith in my skill
as a pilot.”</p>

<p>Loring took hold of the bridles and turned
the ponies. Then mounting, they rode into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
darkness, where a slight thread of openness
seemed to show their path. Time and time again
the horses, sure-footed as they were, stumbled
and went down on their knees, only to pick
themselves up with a shake and a plunge. Wandering
cattle had beaten so many blind paths
through the chaparral or between the rocks that
the riders were often forced to stop and retrace
their way, searching for new openings. Stephen
was afraid. It was a new sensation for him to
have any dread of the uncertain; but every time
that Miss Cameron’s horse slipped or hesitated
he turned nervously in the saddle on the lookout
for some accident to her. His was a nature which
danger elated, but responsibility depressed.
Had he been alone he would have rejoiced in the
stubbornness of the way, in the rasp of the cactus
as his boots scratched against it, in the uncertain
sliding and the quick checking of his
horse; but now they worried him, so intent was
he on the safety of the girl with him. He knew
that only good fortune could find their way for
them before sunrise and he prayed for good fortune
in a way that made up for his past unbelief
in such a thing.</p>

<p>Jean’s cheerfulness and acceptance of conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
only made it harder for him, as, with every
sense alert, he led the way towards what he
hoped was their goal.</p>

<p>And fear was not the only emotion that struck
at his heart. Mingled with his anxiety was a
rushing glow of happiness, of fierce exultation
such as he had never experienced in his life.
The fact that under his care, alone in the Arizona
night, was the girl whom he loved, thrilled
and shook him. The soft note of confidence in
her voice, her unconscious appeal to him for
protection, made the stinging blood rush to his
face, made him crush the bridle in a grip as of
a vise. “Alone!” he murmured. “Is there in
God’s world any such aloneness as two together
when the world is a countless distance away,
when each second is precious as a lifetime!”
His voice, when he spoke to her, sounded to him
dry and forced. It was only by superhuman
control that when he guided her horse to the
right or left he did not cry out his need of her.
Yet through all the electric silence he knew that
he had no right to speak of love, no right even to
love her. His mood was of that intensity which
cares not for its reaction on others. Through it
all he did not think or imagine that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
care; and yet he was happy, happy with that
joy of a great emotion so sweeping as not to
know pain from pleasure and not to care. For
the first time in his life he realized what it was
to live, not to think or to care, but to <em>live</em>.</p>

<p>And she? She could not have been a woman
and not have known, even though the imprisoned
words had not escaped; but from knowing
to caring is a very long road, and not only has it
many turnings, but often it doubles upon itself.</p>

<p>After an hour of this blind riding, they suddenly
found themselves following a well-beaten
track. A tip of bright gold appeared from behind
the black mountains, then a crescent, then a
semicircle, and almost before they realized it
the trail was flooded with the splendor of the
full-rounded moon. As they watched, they were
startled by the soft thud of a horse’s hoofs behind
them. Stephen, a bit uneasy as to the newcomer,
wheeled his horse sharply to meet him,
and slipped his riding gauntlet from his right
hand, prepared to shoot or to shake as the occasion
might necessitate. He was greatly surprised,
when the stranger drew abreast of them,
to hear him exclaim in a cheerful bass voice:
“Miss Cameron! How did you come here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is just what we want to know. The
only thing we want to know more is how to get
out by any other way than past the cliff which
we almost rode over in the darkness. This is
Mr. Loring, Mr. Bingham, one of the hoist engineers
at Quentin. Darkness overtook us
while we were riding, and I thought that I knew
a short cut. I did not, it seems, and here we
are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a mighty narrow escape you had
if you were up by the divide yonder. It drops off
a good five hundred feet. Cleverness of your
horses, I suppose. Positively uncanny the instinct
of those little beasts! Well, as it happens,
you have been riding only a few rods from
the path which you were looking for, only that
winds around the divide, and not over it. I am
on my way to our camp just below here. You’ll
stop to supper with us, of course,” he added, as
the lights of his camp suddenly twinkled from
behind a spur in the hills.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, thank you,” Jean answered.
“I am afraid that my father will be worried as
it is, and would soon be scouring the mountains
for us.”</p>

<p>“It might look a little as if you’d run off together,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Mr. Bingham chuckled with obtuse
humor. Suddenly Jean, who had been all gratitude,
felt that she could, with great pleasure,
see him go over the cliff which they had avoided.
She would have liked to reply to his remark with
something either jocular or haughty; but instead
she was conscious of a stiff, shy pause, broken by
Loring’s query as to how the ore was running
in the Bingham mine.</p>

<p>“Decidedly he is a gentleman,” reflected
Jean, and then the scene of her talk with her
father flashed over her,—the porch, the living-room,
the guitar, the song “She’s o’er the border
and awa’ wi’ Jock o’ Hazeldean.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed aloud. Both men
turned in their saddles to see what could have
caused her sudden mirth. “Only an echo,” Jean
explained. “It sounded like a girl’s voice. It
is gone now. Don’t stop!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bingham seemed so grieved to have them
pass the camp without dismounting that Jean,
realizing that a neglect of his proffered hospitality
would wound him unnecessarily, consented
to take a cup of coffee. Mrs. Bingham
brought it to them with her own hands, talking
to them eagerly as they drank it. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Bingham drew out his flask and offered it to
Stephen; but with a glance at Jean, he declined
it and the girl noted the sacrifice with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The coffee finished, Jean and Loring bade a
hasty farewell to their hosts, who grieved over
their parting with that true Western hospitality
born of the desolate hills, the long reaches of
sparsely populated country, and the loneliness
of camp life.</p>

<p>The horses were tired; but their riders had no
notion of sparing them, and rode as fast as the
roughness of the trail permitted. Mr. Bingham’s
ill-timed words had jarred upon their
companionship, and the horses’ hoofs alone
broke the silence which had fallen between
them.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock when they reached
Quentin, and Mr. Cameron was pacing the
porch impatiently, peering out into the blackness
where the moonlight pierced it, as they
rode up to the shack.</p>

<p>“We are all safe, father; we merely took a
wrong turning,” Jean called aloud as they drew
rein.</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Mr. Cameron with a stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ring in his voice. “I was afraid that you
had.”</p>

<p>Jean perceived her father’s frame of mind instantly,
and the Cameron in her rose to meet
the Cameron in him.</p>

<p>“We have spent a very agreeable afternoon,
however,” she said in clear, determined tones;
“at least I have, so I can scarcely regret our
adventure, though I am sorry to have caused
you anxiety.”</p>

<p>To Loring’s surprise, instead of slipping out
of her saddle as she had done before, she waited
for him to lift her down. As he did so, she felt
his lips brush her sleeve. It was done after the
fashion of a devotee, not of a lover, yet the
girl’s pulses bounded with a sense of elation and
power. She held a man’s soul in her hands.
Yes, she knew now with a sense of certainty
what she had only suspected before,—that
Loring loved her. How she felt herself, how
much response the man’s passion had power to
call out in her, she took no time to think; but
she resolved to use this new power for his good.
It should be the beginning of better things than
he had ever known. Oh, yes, love could do
anything. She had always heard that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Loring, too, would have sworn
that the turning point in his life had come, that
never again could he prove unworthy of the
trust in him which had shone from Jean Cameron’s
eyes and pulsed in the strong clasp of her
hand. A woman’s faith had saved other men
worse than he. Why could he not surely rely
upon its power to save him, too?</p>

<p>One who knew him well might have answered:
“Because you are both too strong and too weak
to be saved by anything from without. Your
regeneration, if it comes, will come from no
such gentle approaches and soft appeals, but
through the stress and storm of deep experience,
through the struggle and agony of overwhelming
remorse. So it must be with some men.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>From the time of their ride together,
Jean’s thoughts were much more occupied
with Loring than they had been
before. The consciousness of her father’s opposition
was an added stimulus, partly by reason
of her inherited obstinacy, and partly because
she felt that Loring was misunderstood, and all
her loyalty was engaged in his behalf. She felt
a pride in having discovered what she thought
were his possibilities, and she was determined
that the world should acknowledge them too.
In the face of Mr. Cameron’s disapproval she
did not venture to ask Loring to the house; but
whenever they met in the camp or on the road
she made a point of stopping to talk with him
and inquiring how things were going at the
hoist.</p>

<p>It must be set down to Loring’s credit that
none of these meetings were of his planning, for
as his love for her deepened, as it did day by
day, he felt more and more keenly the barriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which he himself had raised between them. He
felt how far wrong he had been in assuming that
his life had been wholly his own and that his
failures could touch no one but himself. He did
not dare to construct the future, but clung to the
present with realization of its blessings. He
felt a glow of pride in Jean’s friendship for him,
and a steady reliance on her faith in him. Week
after week went by and the fiber within him
strengthened. The belief in the worthwhileness
of life came to him with a splendid rush of conviction
that was not to be denied.</p>

<p>The depth of happiness is, unfortunately,
however, no criterion of its duration. One
evening the stage, after depositing at the office
its load of mail and newcomers, lurched jerkily
up the incline that led to Mr. Cameron’s house,
instead of being driven to the corral as usual.
Loring watched it and his spirits dropped like a
barometer. An incident may easily depress high
spirits, though it takes an event to raise low
ones. The event which had raised his spirits
to-day was a meeting with Jean Cameron while
Mr. Cameron was inspecting Number Three
shaft. Jean had accompanied her father to the
hoist and Loring had been able to talk with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for a longer time than usual. The incident that
had depressed was merely a slight break in the
routine. He did not usually notice the stage.
Why should he do so now? What was more
natural than that Mr. Cameron should have
some visitor?</p>

<p>“Probably one of the directors of the company,
or some official,” Stephen reflected. “Perhaps
that was why that new saddle was sent down to
the corral.”</p>

<p>Loring shortened his day by dividing it into
periods. A period consisted of the time required
to raise ten buckets of ore. At the end of each
period he permitted himself to glance over his
shoulder, where just beyond the corner of the
ore cribs he could see the porch of Mr. Cameron’s
house. Now and then he was rewarded by a
glimpse of Jean reading or talking to her father.
Loring was very honest with himself and never
before the requisite amount of work was accomplished
did he give himself his reward. This
morning he had gone through the usual routine,
lowered the day’s shift and patiently waited to
hoist the first result of their labor. It had been
a severe strain on his subjective integrity, when,
after he had raised nine buckets of ore, the expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
tenth turned out to be merely a load of
dulled drills sent up to be sharpened. Exasperated,
he watched while the “nipper” boys
unloaded the drills and put in the newly sharpened
sets which they had brought from the
blacksmith’s. One little fellow either unduly
conscientious, or with a wholesome dread of the
wrath of the mine foreman, laboriously counted
the new drills from the short “starters” to the
six- and seven-foot drills that complete the set.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re all right, Ignacio,” called
Stephen. “Chuck them in! <i lang="es">’Sta ’ueno.</i>”</p>

<p>The next time his hopes were fulfilled, and
bucket number ten appeared on the surface.
As soon as it was clear of the shaft and swung
onto the waiting ore car, Stephen turned for
his long-desired glance. Tied to the fence in
front of Mr. Cameron’s house was another
horse beside Jean’s pony, which he knew so
well. As he looked, the door opened and Jean
appeared. She was too far away for him to
distinguish her features and yet she seemed to
him to have an air of buoyancy which he had
not before remarked. A man stepped out of
the doorway behind her. His tan riding-boots
were brilliant with a gloss that is unknown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a world where men shine their own shoes. The
sunlight positively quivered upon them. Jean
and the stranger mounted, and as they rode
nearer to the hoist Stephen observed that the
man was singularly good-looking, but “too
sleek by half,” he growled vindictively, as he
turned to his work again.</p>

<p>The stranger turned out to be a young cousin
of Mr. Cameron’s, ostensibly in camp to see
“western life”; but Stephen had his own
opinion as to that. In a week Loring disliked
the cousin, in a fortnight he loathed him, and
all without ever having exchanged a word with
the dapper youth. A man who by necessity
is compelled to wear a flannel shirt and trousers
frayed by tucking within high boots, is always
prone to consider a better dressed man as dapper.
For a week Stephen had not had a chance to
speak with Miss Cameron. The cousin, “Archibald
Iverach,” as the letters which Loring saw
at the post-office indicated to be his name, may
not have been intentionally responsible; but
to his shadow-like attendance on Jean, Loring
attributed the result and accordingly prayed
for his departure. “To be sure he is her guest;
but that is no reason why he should have too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
good a time,” he reflected gloomily. “She
must be enjoying his visit or she would not
keep him so long.”</p>

<p>Had Loring overheard a conversation which
took place at Mr. Cameron’s table the day
before Iverach’s return to the East, he would
have felt his affection for that gentleman still
more increased. The conversation had turned
upon the types of men in camp. Iverach’s
estimate of them had been as disparaging as
theirs of him. The only men with whom he had
come in contact had annoyed him as having no
place in his neatly constructed world. “Cheap
independence” was the phrase that he had
used to describe their manner. He had good
cause to know this independence for one day
he had addressed McKay in a rather lofty
fashion, and what McKay had said in return
could only be constructed from a careful and
diligent reading of the unexpurgated parts of
all the most lurid books in the world combined.
The retort had been worthy of a territory where
the championship swearing belt is held by one
who can swear between syllables. His remarks
had reflected on Iverach’s parentage on the male
and female sides, it had enlarged on his past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
expatiated on his probable future, dilated upon
his present. The pleasantest of the places that
awaited him, according to McKay, was hotter
than Tombstone in August. His looks and
character had been described in a way that had
surpassed even McKay’s fertile imagination.
Iverach had always imagined that he would
fight a man for using such language to him;
yet for some reason he had not hastened to express
offense. He was not a coward; but he was
not adventurous nor easily aroused to anger
when it might have unpleasant results. Consequently
to-day, when he finished his remarks
about the men whom he had seen by observing
that they were “the scum of the earth,” he
was guilty of no conscious exaggeration.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron paid no attention to his cousin’s
remarks. He had rarely found them rewarding
and therefore with his usual Scotch economy
he declined to waste interest upon them. Jean,
however, for some reason took the trouble to
continue the discussion.</p>

<p>“Have you met a man named Loring, one
of the hoist engineers?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>Iverach looked up suddenly. “Loring? What
is his first name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stephen.”</p>

<p>“I have not met him here; but if he is the
man I think he is, I happen to have heard something
of him in the East. A friend of his asked
me to keep an eye out for him if I came to any
of the camps in Arizona. In fact, he told me to
keep two eyes open for him, one to find him with,
and the other to look out for him after I had
found him. He intimated that Loring was not
a reliable character, to say the least.”</p>

<p>“A friend of his, did you say?”</p>

<p>“I judged that he had been at one time, but
from the trend of his conversation his friendship
must have been a thing of the dim past.
Among other pleasant things about Loring he
told me that—”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about his ability as a
hoist engineer? That, I think, is the only
thing with which we are concerned here,” interrupted
Jean. “You know, Archie, there is
a proverb to the effect that ‘a man’s past is his
own.’”</p>

<p>“Then all I can say is that Loring is not to
be envied his ownership,” Iverach went on,
ignoring the danger signal of Jean’s slightly
contemptuous manner. “And as for discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
his past, I cannot see any harm in repeating
what every one knows about a man.”</p>

<p>Ordinarily Mr. Cameron was the most fair-minded
of men, and judged people by what he
knew of them, not by what he heard; but he
had a particular antipathy to Loring, caused
by dislike of his type, and also he was not sorry
to have Jean hear a few truths about the man
whose companionship he dreaded for her as
much as he resented her championship of him.</p>

<p>“What was it you were going to say about
Loring?” he asked of Iverach, as he handed
him a cigar.</p>

<p>Iverach paused to clip it carefully with a
gold cigar-cutter that hung from his watch-chain.
“Of course it is only hearsay that I am
repeating—” Archibald began hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Then why repeat it?” asked Jean ironically.</p>

<p>“Oh, the most interesting things in the world
are those that you accept on hearsay,” he
laughed. “I forget the details of Loring’s
history, but this friend intimated that Loring,
when engaged to his guardian’s daughter, borrowed
large sums of money from the guardian,
and—well, neither the engagement nor the
money ever materialized and Stephen Loring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
is not much sought after in that neighborhood.
I met the girl once,” he went on, “and I don’t
blame Loring. She was the kind of young
woman whose eyes light up only over causes;
but the money part of the story, if true, is rather
an ugly fact. Dexterity with other people’s
money is not an agreeable form of deftness.”</p>

<p>“Utterly contemptible,” snapped Mr. Cameron,
flicking the ashes from his cigar onto the
table with a prodigal gesture, only to brush
them onto an envelope with the afterthought
of an exact nature.</p>

<p>Jean rose and walked toward the door.</p>

<p>“At what time do you ride this afternoon?”
her cousin called after her.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Jean, without turning,
“but I shall not be able to ride this afternoon,
I am intending to spend the time in making a
pair of curtains for this window. I do not like
the view of the hoist.”</p>

<p>Iverach’s face fell, for he was leaving Quentin
the next day, and he had counted much upon
this last interview. “Can’t the curtains wait
until to-morrow?” he remonstrated.</p>

<p>“No, they must be finished at once,” replied
Jean with decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why this burst of domestic energy?”
queried Mr. Cameron. “You know that you
have not taken a needle in your hand since you
have been in the camp.”</p>

<p>“I intend to change my habits in many ways,”
Jean responded, pressing her lips together
firmly.</p>

<p>“I beg of you not to change at all,” said
Iverach. “It is impossible to improve a perfect
person. However, since you are in the
domestic mood, I wonder if you would take
pity on a helpless bachelor and take a stitch in
my riding-gloves for me?”</p>

<p>“Riding-gloves are a luxury, while curtains
are a necessity,” replied Jean firmly. “However,
if you will give the gloves to me, I will see
that our Chinaman mends them. There is
nothing that he cannot do.”</p>

<p>For some minutes after Jean had left the
room, her cousin contemplated the end of his
cigar. It was hard for him to twist her expressions
into denoting a mood favorable to his
complacency, so he spent an unpleasant half
hour. At last, giving up all hope of her reappearance,
he moodily set forth alone on his ride.
He realized that in the Western setting he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not appeal to Jean Cameron, and only hoped
that when she should return to the East, his
deficiencies would be less apparent, while his
advantages would show more clearly. He
therefore concluded to defer putting his fate
to the touch until circumstances should prove
more propitious.</p>

<p>The curtains took some time in the making.
Jean sewed them with a preoccupied elaboration
such as she was not accustomed to bestow upon
such tasks. She had been startled by the effect
of her cousin’s words upon her, and now stared
at the hem of the curtains with a slight frown.
She had thought her interest in Stephen to be
purely abstract and impersonal, and yet it was
not pleasant to think of the person in whom
she was even abstractly interested as having
been concerned in a dubious financial transaction.
It certainly added interest to the problem
of his regeneration; but nevertheless it abated
the zeal for solving that problem, by making it
seem not worth while.</p>

<p>Stephen rejoiced when the day came for
Iverach to leave Quentin. He hoped that now
his relations with Miss Cameron would be resumed.
He was amazed to see how much he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
had come to rely on his glimpses of her as the
inspiration of his existence. The first time
that he saw her, however, she passed him with
a cool nod in which it would have been hard
for any one to find encouragement or inspiration.
When this coolness was repeated on
several occasions he was puzzled. Then he
made up his mind that the underlying reason
was the cousin, and in this he was certainly
correct, though not in the way he supposed.
For the first time he began to realize that the
work at the hoist was monotonous.</p>

<p>The Devil has three great allies, natural depravity,
aimless activity, and ennui, and this last
is his most trusted, subtle, and reliable agent,
especially when coupled with depression.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>For three days it had been raining in
camp, and the roads were mired with
brownish red ’dobe mud. In the tents
the little stoves failed to dry the reeking air.
The ponies looked miserable, human beings
hopeless. Men tracked into the office, wet and
disgusted, their dirty “slickers” dripping little
pools of water wherever they stood. The rain
fell with a dull rattle on the galvanized iron
roofing, steady, relentless. Even the “shots”
from the workings sounded dull and dejected
in the heavy atmosphere. Every one was irritable
and in an unpleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>Rain in Arizona is rare; but when it does
come it is the coldest, wettest, slimiest rain in
the world. It rains from above, from below,
from the side. It dissolves rubber; it takes
the heat from fire. Water-tight buildings are
mere sport for it. It rains in big drops that
splash, in fine drizzle that penetrates, in sheets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that drench. The soft rock melts and becomes
mud. The dirt dissolves and becomes quicksand.
Empty gulches become torrents; small
streams become rivers. Even the “Gila monsters,”
those slimy, mottled, bottle-eyed, lizard-shaped
reptiles, give up in despair, while mere
man has no chance at all for happiness and
comfort.</p>

<p>Stephen came back from his work at the
hoist, soaked to the skin, and sick. To add to
his discouragement he found orders to work
a double shift waiting for him in his tent—the
engineer of the eleven o’clock, or “graveyard,”
shift being incapacitated. He threw
himself down on his cot, cursing the squeak of
the rusty springs. His feet felt like moist lumps
of clay. The dampness of his shirt sent a numb
feeling through his stomach. Lynn, his tent-mate,
was on shift, so there was nothing to do
but stare at the one ornament of the tent, a
battered tin alarm clock, which, ticking with
exasperating monotony, hung from the ridge-pole
of the tent. The sole reading matter at
hand was an old copy of the Denver <cite>Post</cite>.
Stephen knew this almost by heart; but he
picked it up and began to reread it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be a Booster! Get the convention for your
city! Don’t go to sleep!”</p>

<p>The words, in flaming red and black headlines,
irritated him. Throwing the paper aside,
he amused himself by drawing his fingernail
along the wet canvas of the tent, and watching
the water ooze through the weave. Occasionally
from outside he could hear the cursing of the
coke wagon drivers, and the merciless crack of
their whips. In his mind he could see almost
as well as if he had been outside, the six quivering,
straining horses, their haunches worn raw
by the traces, the creaking wagon, up to its
hubs in mud, and the slipping of the rusty brake
shoes.</p>

<p>As he lay there in quiet misery, with renewed
strength the utter hopelessness of his life came
to him. It was not so much the thought of the
present that crushed, but the knowledge that
for years a life like this was all that lay before
him. The ride of three odd months ago with
Jean Cameron had awakened him to visions
of things that lay beyond him.</p>

<p>He shivered with cold, and pulled the dirty
red blanket up over him. Uncalled for, the
thought of the saloon up on the hill came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his mind. He imagined himself leaning against
a bar, the edge fitting comfortably into his side,
drinking warm drinks, and feeling that life was
worth while. He tried to drive the thought
away. It was useless.</p>

<p>Jean Cameron for months now had been his
idol, had seemed to him to represent his better
self. With an effort he brought her face before
him. The vision was all blurred. Her eyes
seemed to look away from him. She seemed
intangible, unreal, compared with the comfort
which he knew that drink would bring.</p>

<p>“What is the use, anyhow?” he murmured
to himself.</p>

<p>He turned irresolutely upon his cot, then he
jumped up and out onto the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn it, I will!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He jammed his hat down over his eyes,
struggled into his drenched “slicker,” and
started out into the muddy road. As he waded
down to the corral, his boots squashed in sodden
resentment.</p>

<p>Loring for a moment wavered irresolute
while he was saddling his pony.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” he muttered.</p>

<p>But even as he said it, he gave the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
turn to the cinch knot, and swung into the
saddle.</p>

<p>Moodily he rode up the trail. It rained
harder than ever. The pony slipped, slid, and
scrambled. Stephen sat in the saddle, stiff as
an image. His face was drawn with lines that
were not pleasant to look upon. The corners
of his mouth were drawn hard down, telling of
tightly clenched teeth.</p>

<p>When he reached the saloon he dismounted,
hastily tied his horse to a bush, and went in.
In one corner of the shack a stove was burning
warmly. The pine boards of the flooring were
smooth and white.</p>

<p>The bar, which was made of packing boxes
covered with oiled cloth, ran the whole length of
the room on the right-hand side from the door.
At the left-hand side were a couple of small
green baize-covered tables. By these were
seated several Mexicans, all more or less drunk.
They were singing noisily. Along the wall
behind the bar ran a shelf which supported
a large array of bottles. Behind these, in
imitation of the cheap gaudiness of a city
saloon, was a long, cracked mirror. Two Colt
revolvers lying grimly on the shelf gave a delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
hint to guests to behave themselves, and
to pay their bills.</p>

<p>The Mexicans looked in a stupid, vacant
way at Loring, then went on with their singing.
The barkeeper was leaning against the wall,
biting the end from a cigar, and at the same
time whistling. This accomplishment was
made possible by the fact that two front teeth
were missing. It was rumored that in addition
to smoking and whistling, he could curse and
expectorate, all at the same time.</p>

<p>The possessor of these remarkable accomplishments
greeted Stephen in a friendly fashion.
They had often before met in the camp, when
Hankins came down from the saloon for
supplies.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mr. Loring, I’m glad to see
you. Mean weather out, ain’t it? First time
you’ve been up to our diggings, I guess,” he
said, while he gripped Stephen’s hand with a
crushing grasp.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the first time I have had a chance
to drop in,” rejoined Loring.</p>

<p>Some one rode up to the door, and with
heavy tread, and jangling of spurs, came stamping
into the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“How are you stacking up, Jackie?” asked
Hankins of the newcomer. “Say, Mr. Loring,
I want you to know my partner; Mr. Jackson,
shake hands with Mr. Loring.” The introduction
accomplished, he stepped back behind the
bar.</p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to have to drink, gents?
This one is on the house.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Whisky for me, please,” answered
Loring.</p>

<p>“Whisky? All right. I have some pretty good
stuff here. No more kick to it than from a little
lamb. Have some too, Jackie? I thought so.”</p>

<p>Hankins poured the golden fluid into three
gray-looking glasses.</p>

<p>“Regards, gents!” he said in a businesslike
tone of voice, raising his glass as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Regards,” echoed Loring, emptying his
glass at a gulp.</p>

<p>The whisky sent a warm glow through his
frame.</p>

<p>“That was good,” he said, in a judicial tone
of voice. “Now won’t you gentlemen take
something with me?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care if I do,” answered Hankins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The same formula, “Regards,” was repeated.</p>

<p>Loring leaned in comfort against the bar. The
attitude, unfortunately, was not strange to him.
Time and time again, on Stephen’s invitation,
the glasses were refilled, while every now and
then Hankins insisted, “One on the house.”
After the first two drinks, however, the latter
and his partner drank only beer, while Loring
continued to drink straight whisky. The other
men had one by one departed, so that Loring
and his companions were left alone.</p>

<p>Stephen’s face began to burn. He caught a
glimpse of himself in the mirror that hung behind
the bar. Somehow the dull-eyed, white
face which looked back at him seemed to have
no connection with the radiant creature that he
felt himself to be.</p>

<p>At this juncture Jackson made a suggestion.</p>

<p>“What do you say to a little game, gents?”</p>

<p>“By—all—means,” exclaimed Loring, emphasizing
each word as if it were the last of the
sentence.</p>

<p>Hankins, stooping behind the bar, brought
up a pack of cards.</p>

<p>“Here’s an unopened deck,” he said. With
queer little side look at his partner, he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
on. “I’ll get even with you for our last game,
Jackie.”</p>

<p>Stephen, with footsteps that came down very
hard, walked over to one of the tables. Then he
stopped.</p>

<p>“I—haven’t—got—much—money—here,”
he said. He enunciated with the heavy,
precise diction of a man who knows, but will
not believe that he is drunk.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jackson. “Your
I. O. U. goes with us. We ain’t like a boardin’-house
keeper I used to know in Los Angeles,
who had a sign hung out over his place: ‘We
only trust God.’”</p>

<p>Stephen and Jackson sat down at the table,
and the latter began to shuffle the cards vigorously.</p>

<p>“Another whisky, please,” called Stephen to
Hankins. He spoke as if a “whisky please”
were a special sort of drink.</p>

<p>“A beer for me too,” called Jackson. Hankins
brought the drinks on a little tin tray. Before
taking each glass from it, he mechanically
clicked the bottom against the edge of the
tray.</p>

<p>Stephen fumbled in his pocket for change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t pay now,” drawled Jackson. “Drinks
is on the game. Winner shells up for the
pleasure he has had.”</p>

<p>Hankins joined them at the table, remarking
as he sat down: “What’s the chips wuth?”
He nodded assent to Stephen’s rather indistinct
answer.</p>

<p>“Freeze-out? Play till some one goes broke?
Let her drive, Jackie!”</p>

<p>Jackson dealt with rapid precision, emphasizing
each round by banging his own card
down hard on the table. All looked at their
hands, while the dealer drawled softly: “Kyards,
gents? Kyards—three for you, Mr. Loring?”</p>

<p>For three hours they played. Every little
while Hankins rose, and brought more drinks.</p>

<p>“On the game, gents, on the game!” he exclaimed
each time.</p>

<p>Sometimes one was ahead, sometimes another,
but no one had any decided advantage.
Stephen played mechanically. The voices of the
other men seemed to him far away, and indistinct.</p>

<p>Then the luck changed, and Loring began to
win steadily. His success drew him on. He
played recklessly, but by some sport of fate continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to win. He had a stiff smile upon his
lips, and was evidently playing blindly.</p>

<p>“Say, Hankie, I guess we are being bitten,”
remarked Jackson dryly.</p>

<p>“It sure looks that way. Mr. Loring here is a
great player. We didn’t know what we were
up against, did we?”</p>

<p>In his maudlin condition these words delighted
Stephen. With only a pair of threes in his hand
he pulled in a stack of chips, on which the
others had dropped out.</p>

<p>Hankins was shuffling, preparatory to his deal.
As he twisted the cards in his fingers, he gave a
vivid, if immoral, account of his last trip to Tucson.
Loring’s head was swimming, but he
caught the words: “She was the stuff all right,
all right.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Jackson jumped to his feet, and
stood as if listening intently.</p>

<p>“I guess your <i lang="es">caballo</i> must be loose, Mr. Loring;
seems to me I hear him sort of stamping
round outside. Did you hitch him tight?”</p>

<p>Loring staggered to the door and looked out.
From the blackness came a gust of wind and
rain that cooled his flushed forehead.</p>

<p>“I think he’s all right. Can’t see anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at all. Must have been wind you heard. Big,
big wind outside.”</p>

<p>During his absence from the table, Hankins
had dealt. Stephen picked up his cards. At
first he could not distinguish them. They seemed
to be all a blur of color. Then it slowly dawned
upon him that he held four kings and a jack.
His head reeled with excitement.</p>

<p>“Any objection to raising limit?” he asked
eagerly, with an unconcealed look of triumph
upon his face.</p>

<p>“Wa-al, of course, if you want to, we’ll come
along, just to make the game interesting,”
drawled Jackson; “I guess you have us stung
all right. Only one card for you? Gawd, you
must have a fat hand!”</p>

<p>Loring kept raising and raising, until he
reached the limit of all that he owned in the
world. Then, for drunk or sober, he was no
man to bet what he did not have, he called.
Throwing his cards face upwards upon the
table, he reached unsteadily for the huge pile
of chips.</p>

<p>“F-Four kings!” he shouted exultantly. “I—think—they
are good.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="440" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘It seems like as if you was bitten, Mr. Loring,’ said
Hankins.” <a href="#Page_125"><i>Page 125</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>Jackson looked at Stephen’s half-shut eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
at the heavy way his elbow rested on the table,
and smiled. Then with a broad wink at Hankins,
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned. Ain’t this the luck!
Here’s four aces! By Gawd!”</p>

<p>“It seems like as if you was bitten, Mr. Loring,”
said Hankins. “Great game that was.
Well, gents, have another drink now on the
house.”</p>

<p>Stephen, in a dazed manner, took his drink,
then dimly there came into his mind his orders
to work night shift.</p>

<p>“What—whatsh the time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s close to ten,” answered Jackson.</p>

<p>The faint idea kept crawling in Loring’s
mind: “Night shift, hoist, must go.” He
plunged out into the darkness, and tried to drag
himself into the saddle.</p>

<p>When he had gone the two other men roared
with laughter.</p>

<p>“That was easy,” exclaimed Jackson, “but
I guess we had better look after him a bit now,
or he will be in trouble.” They went out after
Stephen, and found him still trying to climb into
the saddle. Each time that he tried, he almost
succeeded, then he swayed, and fell back onto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the muddy ground. The pony, under these unusual
proceedings, was growing restive. They
lifted Stephen onto the horse. He lurched, and
almost fell off on the other side.</p>

<p>“Easy now. You’re all right,” said Jackson.</p>

<p>Taking the pony by the bridle he led him into
the saloon. With Loring swaying in the saddle,
the horse walked listlessly up to the bar, while
Hankins playfully pulled his tail.</p>

<p>“Great pony, that, Mr. Loring; he knows a
good place, all right. He’ll take you down
the trail fine as can be. He’s a wise one,
for sure.”</p>

<p>They led the pony to the door again, the hoofs
creaking strangely on the wooden floor.</p>

<p>“Look out for your head, Mr. Loring!
That’s good. <i lang="es">Á Dios</i>—good night!”</p>

<p>From the trail Loring’s voice carried back.
He was singing at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>“Full right up to his ears!” ejaculated Hankins.
“I hope he don’t fall off and break his
neck.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the faithful little horse trudged
steadily down the trail, carrying his helpless
master. There are few Arizona horses which do
not understand the symptoms indicated by a limp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
weight in the saddle, and meaningless tugs on the
bridle.</p>

<p>The camp, save for the flare by the smelter,
was unlit. The pony went straight to the corral,
past all the dark, silent tents and shacks. The
sound of the hoof-beats echoed very clearly in
the stillness. At the corral Loring tried to dismount,
and fell from the saddle hard. The
shock roused his consciousness.</p>

<p>“Must be near ’leven. What, what wash I
going—going to do at ’leven? Oh, yes. Hoist,
extra shift.” Leaving the poor pony standing
still saddled in the rain, he started up the hill for
the hoist.</p>

<p>Reaching the steps of the deserted <i lang="es">tienda</i>,
he sat down and supported his head with his
hands.</p>

<p>“I <em>guess</em> I must be—a bit—tight,” he
thought.</p>

<p>The world began to whirl, to drop suddenly,
to rise, to twist. He bit his lips and pressed his
knuckles hard against his temples.</p>

<p>“Must sober up!” he kept repeating to himself.</p>

<p>Sweat broke out all over him. He became
ghastly ill. Lying at full length in the muddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
road, before the steps, he did not notice the rain
that beat down upon him. Gradually he began
to lose consciousness.</p>

<p>The whistle blew dull and discordant for the
eleven o’clock shift.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>As the echo of the whistle died away, Loring
raised himself, and staggered to his
feet. Not realizing what he did, he
groped his way onward up the hill. As he passed
the men hurrying home from the last shift, he
noticed, as in a dream, the way in which the wet
clothes clung to their skins, the heavy folds accentuated
by the glare of the occasional electric
light.</p>

<p>Hughson, in the hoist shed, was cursing volubly
at his delay in coming. As soon as he saw
Loring he grabbed his coat, and calling out a
hurried imprecation, started down the hill.</p>

<p>Stephen had scarcely stepped to his place by
the drum, when the indicator clanged sharply
one bell. Mechanically he threw his weight
against the lever, and shot the first bucket of ore
mined by the shift high into the dim light, almost
into the tripod framework upon which the
cable hung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncomprehendingly, he watched the figures
outside bang down the iron coverings over the
shaft, and wheel the clanking ore car onto the
tracks beneath the suspended bucket. The men
seemed to Loring to be possessed of magical
deftness as they unshackled the full bucket,
and clamped the swinging hook through the bar
of the empty one. The loaded ore car bumped
groaningly off on its journey down to the cribs,
the iron coverings opened, and a voice called:
“Lower!”</p>

<p>At times Stephen’s head cleared somewhat,
and he noticed every detail in the hoist shed.
He stared at the way the shadows from the one
electric light fell on the rough boards. The water
jug in the corner, the disordered tool box, the
little pile of oily waste by the boiler, all photographed
themselves on his eye. He noticed the
great pile of beams in the back of the shed,
the timbering for the new shaft, lettered with
huge blue stencils, and watched with interest
the flare in the furnace when the Mexican stoker
threw fresh armfuls of mesquite wood upon the
fire.</p>

<p>Then again all was whirl, and he was obliged
to grip his stool to keep from falling. His hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
clung to the control lever with damp, clinging
pressure.</p>

<p>Every few minutes the gong would sound,
telling that another load of ore was waiting to be
raised. Once he ran the “skip” so high above
the shaft, that it crashed into the framework.
It seemed to be some one entirely disconnected
with himself who fumbled with the winch, and
lowered the bucket again, until the shrill:
“O. K.! <i lang="es">’Sta ’ueno!</i>” from the darkness outside
told of the proper level. Between the striking
of the bells, Stephen puzzled over the meaning
of the white painted bands on the cable, which
should have told him at what level the bucket
was.</p>

<p>The time seemed to drag endlessly. Still the
buckets continued to come. Just outside the
door of the shed he could see the peg board that
indicated the tally of buckets raised. He swore
at it bitterly. “Why can’t the checker put in
two pegs at a time, until the board is full, and
the shift finished?” he thought.</p>

<p>Whenever the winch was in motion, the grating
roar of the cable winding in or out seemed
to be inside his own head. Steadily he became
more and more bewildered. His will was rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
losing the desperate fight for control. Once he
fell off his stool.</p>

<p>There was a slight delay in the work. The
next bucket was slow in being signaled.</p>

<p>“What lazy men—what lazy men!” he
murmured.</p>

<p>Then clear and sharp rang the signal: “Clang—Clang—Clang——Clang!”
Loring was too dazed
to remember that three bells before the one to
hoist was the signal for “man on the bucket.”
The one bell telling to raise, or two to lower, had
conveyed their meaning automatically to him.
The sudden change was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>“Clang—Clang—Clang——Clang!” again
the indicator rang. This time with a sharp, insistent
sound.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they want it to come up fast. Oh,
very, very fast,” was the thought that came to
him, and he threw the lever all the way over.
Fascinated, he watched the cable tearing past
him on the drum.</p>

<p>“Funny—they—should—signal—that—way,”
he spoke aloud. “Perhaps—they—are—drunk—too.”</p>

<p>Faster and faster whirled the reel. The mark
for the four hundred level flashed by. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in an instant the marking for the three hundred
followed. The blur of white upon the cable,
telling that the bucket was only two hundred feet
below the surface seemed to come within a
second. He did not see the marking for the last
hundred feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the bowels of the earth shot
the bucket. For a sixtieth of a second two
figures, standing on the edge, were outlined.
Loring heard a shriek, half drowned in a crash
and roar, as the bucket, with its human freight,
was hurled against the overhead supports.</p>

<p>He smiled foolishly, and hopelessly fingered
the lever.</p>

<p>Outside, by the shaft mouth, all was in wild
confusion. Shouts, curses, hoarse whispers, all
were intermingled. Then came the sound of
feet, tramping in unison, and men entered the
shed carrying a—thing—its head driven into
its shoulders. Loring looked—stared—then
he knew.</p>

<p>Like a knife cutting into the mist of dizziness
came realization. The truth burned its way
into his mind, and sobered him.</p>

<p>“My God!” he sobbed. “The signal was
for men on the bucket.” It flashed upon him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
what had happened. The men, standing upon
the edge of the bucket, holding onto the cable,
had been dashed into the tripod framework,
which overhung the shaft mouth, a scant ten
feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Shaking, as with ague, he stepped outside
to the shaft.</p>

<p>A crowd of Mexicans were jabbering. The
voices of several Americans carried above the
soft slur of the Spanish. Some one was holding
lantern over the mouth of the shaft, and
cautiously peering down. Up the hill came
the sound of running feet.</p>

<p>“Here’s the Doc, now!” called some one.</p>

<p>They showed Dr. Kline the body on the floor
of the hoist box. He merely glanced at it, then
picking up a burlap sack laid it over the head.</p>

<p>“Where is the other man?” he asked curtly.</p>

<p>Some one, with a quick gesture, pointed
towards the shaft. “Down there.”</p>

<p>A small, close set ladder, for use in case of
emergency, ran down the shaft. Down this
two of the Americans started to climb. The
group by the edge watched breathlessly, while
the light of their lantern dropped—dropped—dropped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first twenty feet the lantern illuminated
the greasy sides of the shaft, bringing
out clearly the knots and chinks in the boards.
Then the light shrank into the darkness, became
a mere dot. After a long minute the dot
began to sway back and forth. But so far down
was it that it seemed to have a radius only of
inches.</p>

<p>“They have found him,” breathed McKay,
who had reached the scene. On the iron piping
of the shaft pump tapped dully the signal to
lower slowly. Loring started for his place at the
engine.</p>

<p>“Get to hell out of here! You’ve done
enough harm for one night.”</p>

<p>Hughson, with his white night-shirt half out
of his trousers, his boots unlaced, and his eyes
still heavy from sleep, shoved him aside and
took hold of the lever. Slowly he lowered the
“skip.” It seemed to Loring an hour before
it reached the bottom.</p>

<p>Then again on the pipe, for the bellrope
was broken, was rapped the signal.
“One—one—one——one.” In the night air
the clank of the taps on the metal sounded
ghostly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the bucket came to the surface. The
two men who had descended were holding in it
a swaying figure. Many hands lifted the figure
gently to the ground. The doctor bent over it,
then shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” he said dryly, and they
laid the body beside the other.</p>

<p>A commanding voice echoed through the
group. It was Mr. Cameron’s.</p>

<p>“Where is Loring?” he asked decisively.</p>

<p>Stephen, in the background, turned away,
and, with a face like chalk etched with
acid, stumbled down the hill. Complete
agony possessed him. Hitherto, when he had
failed, he had hurt himself alone. Now he
was little better than a murderer. Drunk on
duty, when men’s lives were dependent upon
him!</p>

<p>By some blind instinct he found his way
to his tent, pulled back the flap, and entered.
Lynn was snoring quietly in his corner. His
boots lay on the floor, strange shapes in the dark.
The alarm clock standing on the table close by
his head ticked softly and monotonously.</p>

<p>Loring gasped for breath, swayed, and fell
unconscious upon his cot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The bodies of the two miners had been carried
to the hospital, and with Hughson in charge
of the hoist, the ore buckets were again coming
up, when Mr. Cameron and McKay left the
scene of the accident and through the darkness
groped their way down the hill.</p>

<p>“Some one told me that he’d seen Loring
drinking this evening,” said McKay.</p>

<p>“That explains all,” answered Mr. Cameron
gruffly. “I should have known! I should have
known! After the experience with men that I
have had, to put a man like Loring in a position
of responsibility! I am the one who is to blame
for this. And yet he did seem to have pulled
himself together. This will finish him, though.
Mark me, McKay, before this he has been going
to hell with the brakes on. Now he will run
wild. Two men dead! That is a rather heavy
reckoning for Mr. Stephen Loring to settle
with himself. If I did not owe so much to
him, I would have him in prison for to-night’s
work.”</p>

<p>McKay nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“I liked him a lot. I thought that he had
different stuff in him. As you say, this will
probably finish his chances; but it may,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hesitated, “it may make a man out of him. If
this don’t, God himself can’t help him.”</p>

<p>“What were the names of the men?” asked
Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p>“Marques was one. He used to work for me.
The other was a new man, Duran, or Doran,
some one said was his name.”</p>

<p>“Were they married?” queried Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is a blessing. Well, good night,
McKay. I shall see Loring in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” answered McKay, and he
added under his breath: “I think I’d rather
not be Loring in the morning. Too bad! Too
bad!”</p>

<p>There was a light in Mr. Cameron’s house.
As her father tramped up the steps Jean threw
open the door and came towards him. Her hair
fell in waves over her dressing-gown. The
candle in her hand threw its light into eyes
which asked an anxious question from beneath
their arching brows.</p>

<p>“Father, what is the matter?” Jean exclaimed,
as Mr. Cameron advanced.</p>

<p>“There has been an accident at Number
Three hoist,” answered Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean drew a quick sharp breath. “Is Mr.
Loring hurt?” she asked, bending forward to
look into her father’s face.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron looked at her hard. Then a
grim humor glinted in his eyes as he answered:
“Loring hurt? Well—not—exactly.”</p>

<p>Without a word Jean turned and led the way
into the living-room, where the hastily lighted
lamp flared high, leaving a smooch of smut on
the chimney and casting bright reflections on
the rough planks of the board wall. The girl
walked calmly to the table and lowered the wick
of the lamp. Then she tossed back the masses
of her hair, and turning sharply to her father
she uttered one word: “Well?”</p>

<p>“Well!” echoed Mr. Cameron, throwing
himself into a chair by the fireplace. “Well!
I should say that was a curious word to describe
to-night’s doings.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean? I mean that your Mr. Loring is a
damned scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it. You speak too harshly.
You are angry.”</p>

<p>“Hum! Perhaps.”</p>

<p>Jean stood with downcast eyes. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
she raised them like a condemned man about
to receive his sentence.</p>

<p>“What has he done?”</p>

<p>“He has murdered two Mexicans.”</p>

<p>Jean shivered and drew the folds of her
dressing gown closer about her. “Mr. Loring
murderer! Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Nothing is impossible to a man when he is
drunk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was drunk, was he? At the shaft,
suppose.”</p>

<p>The note of relief in Jean’s tone seemed
to add the last touch to Mr. Cameron’s exasperation.</p>

<p>“Do you think it was any excuse that Loring
was drunk on duty with men’s lives in his
hands? You women have a queer code.”</p>

<p>“No,” observed Jean, “it is not an excuse.
It is an explanation. That I can understand.
The other I could not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can understand it, too. It
means that I was a fool for trusting him. I
should never have done it, never!”</p>

<p>Jean Cameron stole around to the back of
her father’s chair and leaned over till her face
almost touched his. “Remember,” she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in a low tone, “if he has lost two lives, he saved
one.”</p>

<p>“Damn me! Am I likely to forget it?”
Mr. Cameron answered, shaking off his daughter’s
hands which had been laid lightly on his
shoulders. “Why else did I take him on as
hoist engineer? It was paying a debt, so I
thought. But I had no right to pay at other
men’s risk; and after all I had done for him he
could not have the decency to keep sober on
duty—well, it is too late to think of that now.”</p>

<p>Jean turned away and twisted the curling
ends of her hair slowly about her finger ends.
“Tell me just what happened,” she said
unsteadily.</p>

<p>“It is a short story,” her father answered
gruffly. “Two men in the cage at the bottom
of the mine signaled to raise—engineer, drunk,
sets lever at top speed. If you cannot imagine
what happened, you may take a lantern and go
over yonder to see.”</p>

<p>Jean sank shuddering on the window-seat
and buried her head in the cushions. Her
silence calmed her father’s wrath as her speech
had stirred it. “There, there!” Mr. Cameron
said soothingly, as he walked across to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
window and stroked the bowed head. “It is
nothing for you to be so downhearted about,
my lass. You had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>Still the girl lay motionless.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Jean! It is all over now for
those poor fellows, and as for Loring, you will
never see him again.”</p>

<p>The figure on the window-seat stirred slightly,
and from the pillows a muffled voice asked
tremulously, “What will be done to him?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” answered Mr. Cameron,
“on whether the Mexicans decide on a demonstration
between now and to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Jean, suddenly sitting up and
wheeling about with pale cheeks and flashing
eyes, “they dare not. You would never allow
it. Why are there no men guarding him? It
is as bad as murder.”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” her father replied slowly. “Besides,
if the Mexicans were drunk, you could
not hold them responsible. That would be—what
is it?—‘Not an excuse, but an explanation.’
However, Loring is safe enough for
to-night, and I promise you he will be far away
by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>With these words Mr. Cameron thrust his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hands into his pockets, and rising, strode up
and down the room, the boards creaking under
his slow tread. His daughter leaned against
the window, staring out into the night.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she whispered, as if to some presence
palpable though invisible, “how could you?
How could you do it after what you promised
me?” Then she turned her head and caught
sight of her father’s resolute back.</p>

<p>“He is rather a lovable person,” she said,
with a little catch in her voice. “Don’t you
think he will feel badly enough without much
being said to him about—about the accident?”
Her father laughed a short, uncompromising
laugh.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>The next morning Stephen awoke with
a start, conscious that some one was
standing beside his cot, as he lay fully
dressed outside the blankets. Mr. Cameron
was looking down upon him. When he struggled
to his feet, Loring’s mind was all confused.
He ran his hand through his matted hair.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he murmured.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron’s face was set decisively. It
was easy to see from which parent Jean had
inherited the modeling of the lower portion
of her face.</p>

<p>“Come outside, Loring!” There was a chill
incisiveness in the words which shocked Stephen
into recollection. He followed Mr. Cameron
out of the tent.</p>

<p>The bright, early morning sunlight made
his hot eyeballs water, and he blinked uncomfortably.
His knees shook from weakness so
that he leaned against the fence beside his tent.
Such absolute misery possessed him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
could not think. His brain was numb. His
mouth felt as if all the moisture had been baked
out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron looked him over carefully and
contemptuously, then fumbled in his waistcoat
pocket, and produced a cigar. Eyeing Loring
all the while, he slowly bit off the end, and
lighted the cigar. Before he spoke, he took
several deliberate puffs. It was a good cigar;
but the rich smell of the fumes made Loring
turn a shade whiter.</p>

<p>“Well, Loring, I suppose you know what
this means for you?” began Mr. Cameron
slowly. “A rather nice piece of work of yours,
on the whole. Two men killed by your efficiency!
I do not suppose that there is any use
in asking you if you were drunk?” There was
very little of the question in Mr. Cameron’s
voice.</p>

<p>Stephen gripped the fence hard, then shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I do not like to dismiss you, Loring, for I
am in your debt for saving my daughter’s life.”
Judging from his expression as he said this,
the thought of the debt did not greatly please
Mr. Cameron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen looked out over the mountains. His
eyes were glistening with moisture—and this
time it was not caused by the glare. It cut him
to the quick that the man who was so righteously
dismissing him should be the father of
the girl whom he loved. In a bitter moment
there flashed before his mind the vision of all
his broken resolutions, of his now useless plans
for success. The whole fabric, which in the
past months he had woven for himself, he suddenly
saw torn to shreds.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron’s next words were lost to
Stephen. It was some seconds before he could
again focus his attention. When he caught up
the thread, Mr. Cameron was saying: “I had
hoped better things from you, Loring. I should
have known better, that when a man is a drifter,
such as you are, there is no hope. Still I had
hoped! Well, I was wrong. Here is your pay
check, for what is due to you. That is all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron turned and walked towards
the office. Stephen stood looking dumbly after
him, with the check fluttering loosely in his
fingers. McKay, going by on his way to work,
saw him, and came up to him. He held out his
hand in sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Damn it, Steve, I’m sorry for you! You
ain’t worth a damn; but I like you.”</p>

<p>Stephen looked at him in silence. His only
conscious thought, as he gripped McKay’s
hand, was the mental reiteration: “I am worth
a damn, I am worth a damn.”</p>

<p>McKay went on in friendly solicitude: “Of
course, it ain’t none of my business, Steve, but
if I was you I’d beat it pretty quick. Just
at present the friends of those men ain’t
losing any love on you. I think if I was
in your boots the Dominion trail would look
pretty good to me. It’s about up to you to
<i lang="es">vamos</i>.”</p>

<p>“I will go,” said Loring. “It isn’t that I
fear what these Mexicans may do, because I
don’t care. But I can’t stand it here. Good-bye,
Mac! You have been a good friend to me. I
know I deserved to be fired. Deserved a lot
worse; but Mac,” he added desperately, “I
will make good somewhere!”</p>

<p>McKay almost imperceptibly shook his head,
then smiled and again extended his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, buck up, Steve! I’ve got
to get down to work now. Good-bye, and good
luck!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait just a minute!” Loring called after
him.</p>

<p>McKay turned, and Stephen held out his
newly received pay check.</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to give this to
Hankins up at the saloon, when you get time?
I owe it to him, and to his partner.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did do things up in great
shape last night, Steve,” said McKay, as he took
the check, after Stephen had endorsed it with
a shaking hand. “Got cheated, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” answered Loring.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” thought McKay to himself,
as he walked away, “with fellows like these
saloon keepers. You could give them everything
that you have, and no matter what happened
they would keep it safely for you. But
play cards and they’ll stick it into you for
keeps.”</p>

<p>Re-entering his tent, Stephen began to put
his few belongings into a saddle-bag. His
packing was not a long operation. He looked
rather wistfully about the little tent, which
had grown to seem to him almost a home.
Then, slinging the bag over his shoulder, he
started for the corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It was still very early, and few people were
about. One or two of the Mexican teamsters
were at the corral, sleepily kicking their horses
into the traces. These looked at Stephen blackly,
for in a mining camp news travels very fast.</p>

<p>Stephen’s hands shook so that he had great
difficulty in forcing the bit into the restive jaws
of his pony. At last, however, “<i lang="es">Muy Bueno</i>”
was saddled, and led out into the road. As Loring
was putting up the corral bars again, a bare-footed
little Mexican girl came pattering past.
Stephen had often befriended her in small ways,
so now she greeted him with shy warmth.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Buenos dies, amigo!</i>” she chattered.</p>

<p>The little child’s greeting started the tears to
his eyes. Fumbling in his pocket, from among
his few coins, he brought out a quarter. With a
dismal attempt at a smile, he tossed it to her.</p>

<p>“Eh, Señorita Rosa, here is two bits for you,
<i lang="es">dos reales</i>, buy candy with big pink stripes.”</p>

<p>The child ran up to him and gratefully seized
his hand with both of her grimy little paws. He
cut short her repeated thanks with a quick
“<i lang="es">No hay de que</i>,” and swung into the saddle.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Á Dios</i>,” he called to her. Then slowly he
rode to the watering-trough. “<i lang="es">Muy Bueno</i>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
buried his nose deep in the cool water, and drank
with great gulps. Stephen could feel the barrel
of the pony swell beneath the cinch. When he
could hold no more, “<i lang="es">Muy Bueno</i>” raised his
head from the trough questioningly, the drops of
water about the gray muzzle glistening in the sun.
Stephen pressed the reins against the horse’s
neck, and turned him towards the Dominion
trail, which showed as a ribbon of white upon the
hills to the eastward.</p>

<p>Close behind him he heard a familiar voice
singing an old song: “La, la, boom, boom. La,
la, boom, boom.” The last word was sung with
unusual emphasis, serving as a salutation and
hail.</p>

<p>Wah, beaming with his usual joyousness, was
trotting towards him.</p>

<p>“Hey, me bludder, me bludder. You gettee
canned! Oh, me bludder, you allee samee fool
gettee drunk. You beat it to Dominion? Me
bludder welly wise! La, la, boom, boom!”
Wah concluded his outburst with a peal of
laughter.</p>

<p>Stephen looked down solemnly at him.</p>

<p>“Damned funny, isn’t it, Wah?”</p>

<p>“Oh, me bludder, me bludder!”—Wah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
could get no further, before another paroxysm
of laughter overcame him. Recovering somewhat,
he produced from his blouse a greasy
looking package.</p>

<p>“Me bludder get nothing to eat before he
come to Dominion. Wah bring him pie, oh,
lubbly, lubbly pie.”</p>

<p>Stephen was deeply touched by the Chinaman’s
kindness. He shook his hand warmly.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten all about food. Good-bye,
Wah, and thank you a lot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, me bludder, wait one minnie moming.
I have note. Missee Cameron, she send me
bludder a note!”</p>

<p>Wah, with some labor, produced from his
pocket a little envelope, and handed it to
Loring.</p>

<p>“Oh, lubbly, lubbly note! Oh, lubbly—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Wah!” flared Stephen. White as
death, he took the note from Wah, and slipped
it inside his shirt. He could not trust himself to
read it.</p>

<p>“Please thank her, Wah, and—” He could
say no more. Slowly he turned his horse, and
rode towards the hills.</p>

<p>Wah walked away, murmuring beneath his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
breath: “La, la, boom, boom, me poor bludder.
He must habee hellee headache. La, la, boom,
boom.”</p>

<p>Stephen soon reached the place on the trail
where was situated the old deserted “Q” ranch.
A rusty iron tank by the shanty bore the crudely
painted sign: “Water, Cattle 10 cts. per head.
Horses 25 cts.” Beside the tank, however, in
what had evidently formerly been an empty bed,
gushed a clear stream of water. Stephen smiled
when he saw how nature had thwarted the primitive
monopoly.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he lifted the saddle from his
horse’s back. Then he deftly hobbled him, and
left him to eat what grass there was by the rocky
stream bed, within a radius which he could cover
with his fore legs tied together. Stephen then
seated himself on the ground, propped the saddle
behind his back, and proceeded to light a pipe,
and to think. All the events of the past few
hours had come upon him with such rapidity
that he had had no time for reflection.</p>

<p>Seated there in the open, beneath the vivid
blue sky, with no sound but that of the softly,
coolly running water near, all the scene of the
accident loomed clearly before him, far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
clearly than it had done in the morning when he
had still been in the camp, and surrounded by
the routine of life there. The very warmth of
the sunlight, which should have made a man’s
heart bound with the joy of living, merely added
to the blackness of his mood.</p>

<p>He was very nervous, and smoked with quick,
hard puffs. Once his pony started at something.
The sound brought Loring to his feet, all of a
quiver. He sat down again, wiping the perspiration
from his forehead with an excited gesture.
Gripping his hands together hard, he thought the
situation over and over. The more he thought
of it, the worse it seemed. This was not a case
which could be called the result of negligence, or
drifting. It came very close to crime, and he
knew it. Stephen Loring was a man who, when
he sat in judgment upon himself, was unflinching.
He weakened only when it came to carrying
out the sentence which the court imposed. He
thought of Miss Cameron, as she had been on
the ride which they had taken together; then of
what she must think of him now. This brought
a flush of shame to his cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly he recalled the note which Wah had
brought to him, and he took it reverently from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
his blouse. It was the first time that he had ever
seen her handwriting. His name was written
upon the envelope in clear, decided letters, which
coincided well with the character of the writer.
Stephen looked at the writing, with an infinite
tenderness softening the lines on his face. He
started to tear open the envelope, then suddenly
he stopped.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” he exclaimed, half aloud. “I will
not read it until I am worthy to do so, or until I
have a great need of it.” Reluctantly he slid
the note back into his blouse. Then, coloring,
he pushed it over to his left side. His heart
seemed to beat more strongly, more manfully,
for the companionship.</p>

<p>He had eaten no breakfast, and began to be
conscious of a great hunger. He ate, down to
the last crust, the pie which Wah had given to
him. It was as good as its maker had claimed
it to be.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world equal to food
for restoring self-respect, and Stephen, having
eaten, began to see the world more normally.
Tightening his belt, he took a long drink from
the stream, then saddled “<i lang="es">Muy Bueno</i>” and
started again on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>All the afternoon he rode continually up hill,
till towards five o’clock he struck the Dominion
divide, and timber. The air here, in contrast
to the valley below, was cold, and Loring, only
thinly dressed, shivered. Several times cattle
“outfits” passed him on the trail. Men were
driving in from the range scraggly bunches of
steers, to be fattened before selling. Once he
did not pull his horse out of the trail in time, and
sent a bunch of frightened cattle stampeding
into the underbrush. He was so engrossed in his
thoughts that he hardly noticed the cursing
which he received from the ranchmen.</p>

<p>At dusk, beside the trail, he saw a bright fire
in front of a tent. Two men, occupied in frying
bacon, and boiling coffee, were seated before it.
The smell that arose from the cooking appealed
strongly to Stephen, and he reined in his horse.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger! Making for Dominion?”
one of the men called out. “Well, you won’t
get there for some time yet. It is twelve miles
from here. Better let us stake you to a meal.
Come from Quentin, do you? Me and my pardner
was going there to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Stephen, with alacrity, accepted the proffered
hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Much obliged, friend,” he said. “I’m
pretty well broke, and I was not expecting to
get anything to eat to-night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that. You shan’t go
by our outfit hungry. We ain’t made that way.
There was a cuss I knowed once,” continued one
of Loring’s hosts, “up in Cochise County. I
was broke, flat busted, when I was there, and I
asked him to stake me to a meal, and say, the
mean skunk wouldn’t come through at all. Said
I could ‘watch him eat.’ Now what do you
think of that?” As he recalled the crime against
hospitality, the man kicked vigorously at one
of the logs on the fire.</p>

<p>Loring listened, with due sympathy, to the
tale, the while he eyed with hopeful glances the
coffee-pot, at the edge of which a yellow foam
soon appeared, serving as signal that the meal
was ready.</p>

<p>“Sorry we can’t give you flapjacks,” remarked
one of the men, as he lifted the bacon off the
fire. “Pardner here makes swell ones, but we’re
pretty low on our grub outfit now. Hope we
can get work at Quentin. Any jobs floating
round loose there?”</p>

<p>Stephen slowly filled his tin cup with coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and paused, after the western fashion, to blow
into it a spoonful of condensed milk, before he
answered.</p>

<p>“I am not sure,” he said, “but I think that
there is a vacancy on one of the hoists. I think
they fired a man there recently.”</p>

<p>“That’s good for us,” exclaimed one of the
men. “Wish they’d fire some more!” Stephen
did not continue the discussion.</p>

<p>After a quiet smoke beside the embers of the
fire, Stephen rose, and thanking his hosts
warmly, prepared to leave. As he was mounting
he happened to feel a flask that was in his pocket.
He remembered vaguely having filled it the night
before. Reaching down from the saddle he held
out the flask.</p>

<p>“Have a drink, gentlemen?” he asked.</p>

<p>One of the men took the flask in his hands,
almost reverently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I won’t,” he said. He
took a long pull, then handed the flask to his
partner.</p>

<p>“Regards!” drawled the latter.</p>

<p>The words brought to Loring a bitter train of
memories.</p>

<p>“Keep the damned stuff if you want it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
am through with it,” he said. Then, with a
quick good night, he rode off.</p>

<p>The men, in mild wonder, looked after him
for a moment. Then they relighted their pipes,
and settled themselves by the fire.</p>

<p>“Mighty nice chap, that,” remarked one,
“but he must feel powerful bad about something
to give away good whisky like that.”</p>

<p>It was nearly nine o’clock in the evening
when Stephen rode into Dominion. The main
street was brightly lighted, and as it was Saturday
night, the sidewalks were crowded with
people walking restlessly up and down. The
shop windows glowed attractively. Through
several open doors he could see men gathered
about pool tables. The bright lights by the
cinematograph theater showed clearly the faces
of the passing crowd.</p>

<p>Dominion had passed from the camp into the
town stage, as was evinced by the liberal scattering
of brick houses among those of wooden
construction. Many horsemen were passing in
the street. Fresh from the hills, Loring felt
almost dazed by this renewed contact with established
humanity.</p>

<p>His first care was to seek a stable for “<i lang="es">Muy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Bueno</i>.” Seeing in one of the side streets a
livery sign, he entered the place and tied his
pony among the long line of horses in the shed.
Then, after saying to the proprietor: “Hay and
not oats,” he walked out into the street.</p>

<p>“I hope the confounded expensive little beast
won’t order champagne for himself,” he thought.
“He is almost clever enough to do so.”</p>

<p>As he walked slowly along, he mentally calculated
his resources. Three dollars in cash.
Nothing in credit. A few cents Mexican in
prospect. He would have to sell the pony and
saddle to complete the payment of his poker debt.</p>

<p>A group of men, thoroughly drunk, passed by,
singing noisily. Idly, Stephen followed after
them, until they came to the little creek that runs
through the center of the town. Across the creek,
high above the dark, silent water, lay a narrow
swinging bridge. One of the group of men
called out: “Let’s go across the bridge of sighs
to Mowrie’s.” The others noisily assented and
soon Loring could hear the bridge ahead of him
creaking beneath their weight. He stood for a
moment, hesitating, staring at the lights across
the bridge, then he deliberately followed.</p>

<p>The opposite shore of the creek was lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with “cribs” and shanties stretched in a long,
sodden row along the bank. From many of
them came the brazen notes of gramophones
in a jarring discord of popular tunes. Women’s
voices were mixed with the music, in shrill unpleasant
laughter. A board walk ran before the
close built houses, and up and down this tramped
throngs of men, talking noisily, singing, swearing.
The faces of some group or other were now
and then visible, as some one scratched a match
to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>Women of almost every nationality on the
globe stood in the doorways, French, Japanese,
Negroes, Swedes, all dressed in flaunting
kimonas. They called to the men in the crowd,
exchanged jests, or leaned idly against the
door-posts, staring fixedly into the faces of the
men. From many of the places a bright light
streamed out across the water. The shutters of
several were drawn.</p>

<p>In strange contrast to the scene, in one of the
houses some one was singing in a clear tenor
voice, which sounded as sweet and pure as if it
had been in a choir. For a moment the murmur
of voices and tramp of feet ceased, as people
paused to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen walked slowly down the street. A
woman in one of the darker doorways called out
to him. He stopped, bit his lip hard.</p>

<p>“Why not? What is the use, now?” he
thought.</p>

<p>He ran up the steps and opened the door. Inside,
half a dozen painted women were drinking
with the men there. The proprietress beckoned
to him to enter.</p>

<p>Then like a veil, before his eyes dropped a
cloud of memory. He saw the shed at the
hoist, two bodies laid limply on the ground;
figures moving in dim lantern light.</p>

<p>He staggered out into the street, drew a deep
breath and strode back across the bridge.</p>

<p>“I am through with this sort of thing for
good,” he muttered. “I owe the world too big
a debt of reparation now. But I will pay it.”</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Loring’s smile
was a smile of power, that power which rises
sometimes from a supreme sorrow, sometimes
from supreme holiness, sometimes, as now,
springing from the black soil of crime; but
bespeaking the discipline which has learned to
control passion, to bring desire to heel, and to
make a man master of himself despite all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
devils that this world or the next can send
against him.</p>

<p>He had learned his lesson at last, learned it
at the cost of two lost lives, and the cost to himself
of an overshadowing remorse which he
could never escape, let the future hold what it
would. But he had learned it.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>After three days of fruitless search for
work, Stephen’s outlook upon life grew
very gloomy. Dominion was over-supplied
with laborers. In looking backward,
Stephen felt that he had applied for every sort
of position from bank president to day laborer,
but everywhere the answer had been the same:
“Sorry, but we have nothing for you. We are
even turning off our old workmen.”</p>

<p>In the West, in time of prosperity, positions
and opportunities of every sort go begging.
In time of depression there is no harder place
in which to get work.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Stephen from principle
had always refused to affiliate himself with
one of the labor organizations, and in Dominion
the power of the Union is paramount. Once he
had almost persuaded the foreman at one of
the smelters to put him on the rolls; but when
the fact had appeared that he was a non-Union
man the official had changed his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t risk it. It is all wrong; but if I was
to hire you to-day, why to-morrow I wouldn’t
have three men working.” This had been his
final answer.</p>

<p>Shortly after this experience, Loring had
been approached by a delegate who had tried
to persuade him to join the Miners’ Union.
The delegate had enumerated the advantages,
and they were many,—a sick benefit of ten
dollars a week, friends wherever he should go,
work at high wages, and a seventy-five dollar
funeral when he died. The delegate had asked
Stephen if it were fair that when the Union, by
concerted action, had brought about the prevailing
high scale of wages, outsiders should both
share the advantage, and yet weaken the Union
position by working contrary to the fixed scale.
At the end, as a peroration, the man had cited
the possibilities of crushing capital at the polls,
arguing with the general point of view of such
men, that the chief aim of capital was to crush
labor.</p>

<p>“You needn’t pay your dues until you get
your first month’s wages,” he had concluded.</p>

<p>Stephen had begun to feel that perhaps his
anti-Union convictions had been prejudiced, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the man had clearly shown many good arguments.
Then the delegate, seeing that Stephen
was weakening, had thought to clinch the
matter. Changing his manner, he had shaken
his finger in Loring’s face and said: “If you
don’t join the Union, we’ll see to it that you
don’t get a job in the territory. We’ll send your
picture to every camp in Arizona, and life will
be hell for you. There was a man only last week
who wouldn’t join. He is in the hospital now,
and, by Gawd, he will stay there for a while.”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” Loring had answered.</p>

<p>The man had become all smiles again.</p>

<p>“I thought you would see it that way,” he
had rejoined.</p>

<p>“I think that you misunderstand me,” had
been Stephen’s reply. “I would not join your
Union if you hired me to do so. As a matter
of fact, the Miners’ Union here is not a true
labor union. It is a thugs’ Union, and the
sooner all honest workingmen find it out, the
better for the cause of Unionism throughout
the country.”</p>

<p>The scuffle that had ensued had resulted in
Loring’s favor, but it had not helped him to
find work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning, rather from want of occupation
than from any definite expectations,
Stephen took his place in the post-office at the
general delivery window. He was greatly surprised
when, in answer to his inquiry, the clerk
slipped a letter through the grating. It bore
the Quentin postmark; but the writing was
unfamiliar. Stephen walked across the room,
and leaning in the doorway opened the letter
with curiosity. It was from Mr. Cameron, and
ran in this fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Quentin</span>, September 20th.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Stephen Loring.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I suppose that you realize how final your
actions here must be in regard to any trust being placed
in you. I shall say no more upon the subject. The fact
remains that unfortunately I am in your debt.”</p>

</div>

<p>Stephen read this sentence over several times
before continuing:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I feel bound to make one more effort to repay you,
which must be regarded as final. I have interests in several
companies in Montana, and I will offer you a position
with one of them, on the understanding that you will
never come into my way again or—”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">here several words were scratched out</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You must realize how unpleasant it is for my daughter
to be under any obligation to a man, who, to put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
matter plainly, is a worthless drunkard. In offering this
position to you, I may as well say that this is the only
motive which actuates me. The position is one in which
no responsibility is involved, being merely clerical. The
pay would be sufficient to maintain you as long as you
remain steady. The condition I impose would be
absolute.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Donald H. Cameron</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Stephen noticed with interest the character
of the signature.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that man ever failed at anything,”
he thought. “There is only one thing
that he never learned, and that is how to deal
with a failure.”</p>

<p>It was the noon hour, and the various whistles
told of lunch, for some. Stephen read the letter
over and over.</p>

<p>“Why not accept the offer?” he questioned.
Mr. Cameron could certainly feel no more disrespect
for him than he did now, and the
blatant fact that he was hungry and without
work forced itself upon his attention.</p>

<p>“It means another chance,” he muttered,
and now that he was sure of himself, he knew
that a chance meant success. He thrust the
letter into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hang it, I’ll take him up,” he thought.
“I have been everything else; I may as well be
a grafter.”</p>

<p>As he slid his hand out of his coat pocket,
he felt another envelope. He pulled it out, and
looked longingly at it. It was Jean’s note.
He hesitated, then tore it open.</p>

<p>“I need it now, if ever I shall,” he said to
himself. There was only a line, signed with
Jean’s initials.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>I still believe in you.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p>Stephen read it with bowed head. His
shoulders shook. The paper danced up and
down before his eyes. Over and over he read
the note. Unconsciously he stretched out his
hand, as if to press in gratitude and devotion
the hand of some one before him. At length,
with a start, he came to himself. He returned the
note to his pocket, and in a determined fashion
walked up to a man who was standing near him.</p>

<p>“I would like to borrow two cents for a
stamp,” he said.</p>

<p>The stranger roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, you are broke! Say, friend, I’ll stake
you to a meal, if you’re that hard up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen shook his head: “No, thank you.
I have still my coat, which I can pawn; but I
am much obliged for the stamp.”</p>

<p>He found an odd envelope lying on a table.
Going over to the desk, he addressed this to
Mr. Cameron. Then taking from the waste
basket a sheet of paper, he wrote quickly upon
it five words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I’m damned if I will.”</p>

</div>

<p>He put on the stamp with a hard pound of
his fist, and threw the letter into the mail-box.
Then, with his heart beating joyously, he
walked out of the post-office. Inside his coat
a note lay warm against his heart.</p>

<p>On the corner stood a pawnbroker’s shop.
The brightness of the gilding upon the three
balls showed that it was a successful one. The
place was crowded with men who were disposing
of everything that duty, a mild sense of
decency, or necessity did not for the moment
require. Loring entered the shop, and elbowing
his way to the desk, laid down his coat.
The proprietor picked it up, prodded the cloth
with his thumb-nail, shook his head over the
worn lining, then said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two bits on that.”</p>

<p>Stephen silently took the proffered quarter,
and went out.</p>

<p>“That means one meal, anyhow,” he thought.</p>

<p>A gaudy sign attracted his attention:
“Chinese-American Restaurant”—“All you
can eat for two bits.”</p>

<p>“I think that they do not lose much on their
sign,” he reflected when, a few minutes later,
seated at a counter, he gnawed at some bread
and stew, and drank bitter coffee. “Any man
who ate more than a quarter’s worth would
die.”</p>

<p>Having eaten, he sauntered over to the
cashier’s window and nonchalantly slid his
quarter across the counter. Then no longer
a capitalist, but also no longer hungry, he
stepped out into the street again. He looked
to right and left wondering in what direction
to turn his footsteps. The sight of a crowd in
front of the post-office determined him. He
questioned a man on the outskirts of the group,
and found that the excitement was caused by
a telegram, the contents of which was posted
in the window. Working his way through the
crowd, Loring reached a position whence he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
could make out the notice. The telegram was
from the governor of Sonora, the Mexican
province which lay just across the line from
Dominion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Outbreak of Yaquis. No troops near. Would deeply
appreciate help from Dominion.”</p>

</div>

<p>The crowd was laughing and cheering.</p>

<p>“Me for Old Mexico!” called one.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we’ll all be generals,” shouted
another.</p>

<p>The news had spread like wild-fire, and from
every direction appeared groups of men, armed
with Winchesters, shotguns, or Colts. All were
rushing toward the Southern Pacific station.
Stephen hurried up the street to a gun store,
and by dint of hard persuasion obtained from
the proprietor an old Spencer forty-five calibre,
single shot carbine.</p>

<p>“It will at least make a noise,” thought
Loring. He joined a group of men who were
on their way to the train.</p>

<p>“I might as well go to Mexico as anywhere,”
he reflected. “My responsibilities are not heavy
just at present.”</p>

<p>Within half an hour after the receipt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
telegram in Dominion, three hundred men, all
armed to the teeth, were at the station. For in
a region where the sheriff’s posse is one of the
regular forms of entertainment, there are many
men who joyously start upon an expedition of
this kind.</p>

<p>A cheer arose from the crowd when Harry
Benson, at one time the captain of the “Arizona
Rangers,” appeared upon the scene, clearing
a way for himself by the adept fashion in which
he spat tobacco juice.</p>

<p>“Going along, Harry? Good boy,” some
one called. “You ought to have brought all
the Rangers with you.”</p>

<p>“See here,” answered Benson, “this ain’t in
no wise official business. This is sort of a
pleasure excursion.” There was a howl of
laughter at this, then as the engine whistle
blew sharply, all scampered for places in the
“special” which the railway company had
provided.</p>

<p>A man who was on the front platform of one
of the cars began to sing a song—a very popular
song, of which the verse and chorus were unprintable,
but very singable. With men hanging
out of the windows, standing on the roofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the cars, and with platforms and steps
jammed, the train pulled out of the station,
headed for the Mexican Line, only fifteen miles
away.</p>

<p>Half an hour brought them to the border.
Here were waiting the governor of Sonora and
many Mexicans, who cheered excitedly as the
train drew into the station. Benson, by unanimous
consent, was acting as director-general
of warfare. As the train slowed down, he
jumped to the platform. A Mexican official
resplendent in uniform and gold braid, in strange
contrast to the motley throng following at Benson’s
heels, stepped forward to greet him.
Benson sang out cheerfully: “Hello, here we
are; what is there for us to do?”</p>

<p>While the official was explaining the situation,
he looked a bit anxiously at the crowd,
hoping that when the trouble was over, they
would all depart from the province of Sonora
with the same celerity with which they had come.
It certainly was a hard-looking aggregation.</p>

<p>The Governor talked earnestly with Benson,
speaking excellent English. “I do not know
what to do. According to the laws, no armed
force can enter our territory. It is a bad precedent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
And yet we need help. There are no
troops near Los Andes where the raiders are
feared. Yet the laws are very strict, and as an
officer of the law I must not let them be broken.
The law says plainly: ‘No armed force.’ What
shall I do?” The Governor was in despair over
the situation.</p>

<p>Benson saved the day.</p>

<p>“Look here, Gov,” he said. “I used to be an
officer of the law myself. A man must conform
strictly to the laws; I know all about it. But,”
he added, with a wink, “we’re here, just sort
of a disorganized party as happened to meet on
the train. We was all going hunting near Los
Andes, and we sort of came over without
formalities.”</p>

<p>The Governor’s face beamed with happiness
at this solution.</p>

<p>“It is <i lang="es">magnifico</i>! And as the custom-house
cannot appraise so many weapons at once, you
are permitted to carry them, gentlemen. In
bond, of course, in bond,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>“Yesterday we had news from the hills that
the Yaquis were raiding again,” he said to
Benson. “Two prospectors were killed, not
fifty miles from Los Andes. A bridge on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
main line is down. The troops cannot be there
for twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>Benson nodded comprehendingly. “Same
old trouble, ain’t it? I wonder these Yaquis
wouldn’t get tired. We’ll fix them up good
for you if they come.”</p>

<p>These formalities of international law having
been settled, all again boarded the train, and
a slow hour’s run toward the west brought
them to Los Andes.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this sleepy little town of
Old Mexico thronged about the station and welcomed
their prospective rescuers with enthusiasm.
Loud cries of “<i lang="es">Vivan Los Americanos!</i>”
echoed from end to end of the platform, as the
men swarmed out of the train.</p>

<p>Soon the men were assigned to quarters in
the various houses and shops. The plaza before
the cathedral in the center of the town
became, for probably the first time in its existence,
a scene of activity.</p>

<p>As Benson was completing the disposition
of his men, a Mexican ranch owner rode up to
him.</p>

<p>“The Señor is the <i lang="es">comandante</i>?” he asked in
broken English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, Mike, <i lang="es">Seguro Miguel</i>—Fire away!”
answered Benson.</p>

<p>The ranchman looked puzzled, then commenced
to explain his errand. His ranch, it
appeared, was situated some twenty miles outside
the town, in the direction from which the
Yaquis were expected, and his ranchmen were
all absent upon the range. He asked for five
or six men to defend his <i lang="es">hacienda</i>:</p>

<p>Benson waved his hand airily, in feeble
imitation of the Mexican’s grand manner:
“<i lang="es">’Sta ’ueno</i>, you shall have them.”</p>

<p>Turning, he saw Loring, who had been listening
to the talk. Benson was accustomed to
judging men quickly, and he was rarely deceived.
A quick survey of Loring’s face satisfied him.</p>

<p>“He is no quitter, anyhow,” he thought,
“and at present his moral character don’t
matter.” He called to Loring: “Say, you Mr.
What’s-your-name, you get four other men and
go with this chap to his ranch!”</p>

<p>“Have you <i lang="es">caballos</i> for them here?” Benson
asked the ranchman.</p>

<p>“Sí, sí, I can procure them at once,” exclaimed
Señor Hernandez. “And my gratitude, it is
eternal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said Benson, turning
away.</p>

<p>A very short while sufficed for Stephen to
find four volunteers to accompany them, and
within an hour the little party was riding out
of the town to the southward, where lay the
ranch and the threatened pass. The country
was desolation itself, rocky ground covered
with layers of dust and sand. All was gray in
color. The little clusters of sage-brush, all dried
and lifeless in the heat, made no change in the
gray hue. The road was merely a track across
the desert, beaten by chance horsemen or cattle.
Along this the horses scuffled, sending up clouds
of alkali dust into the air for the benefit of the
riders who were behind.</p>

<p>Stephen rode beside Señor Hernandez, speaking
only in short sentences, to answer or ask
some question. The leather of the saddles, beneath
the sun, was burning hot.</p>

<p>After four hours of riding, just as the sun was
beginning to drop behind the foothills, they
saw before them in the desert a large patch of
green, as vivid as if painted upon the ground,
fresh and succulent, amidst the desolation of
the plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“My alfalfa crop!” exclaimed the Señor,
pointing with pride. “We have irrigated. Much
water. Big crop. <i lang="es">He aqui la casa</i>—there,
behind the alfalfa.”</p>

<p>Stephen saw rise, as if by magic, a long one-story
structure of adobe, so much the color of
the earth as to have been till now almost indistinguishable.
Beside the house was a large
brush corral. So perfectly was all blended with
the landscape, that not until they were very near
did Loring appreciate the great size of the
building.</p>

<p>At the corral they dismounted and unsaddled.</p>

<p>“Better carry the saddles up to the house!”
said Loring to the men, who had hung them
over the corral bars. So, carrying their guns and
saddles, they all walked up to the house.</p>

<p>Here they were received by the ranchman’s
wife, a striking Spanish beauty.</p>

<p>“It is Señora Hernandez,” said the Mexican,
with justifiable pride. The Señora showed the
men the rooms where they were to sleep.
Stephen, as commander, was given the largest
room.</p>

<p>Pepita was very well pleased with the appearance
of the defender whom her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had selected, for in spite of his flannel shirt
and dusty boots, Loring was not bad to look
upon.</p>

<p>In a few moments, Stephen re-entered the
main room. The Señora was there, leaning
against one of the easements. The scarf that
was thrown over her head added to her charms,
and lent a subtlety to her dark beauty. As
Stephen walked across the room toward her,
he admired her greatly.</p>

<p>“By George! She is a beauty,” he exclaimed
under his breath. Then answered a
voice within him: “Yes, but at thirty, she will
be fat, oh, very fat.”</p>

<p>As the Señora turned to greet him, the first
voice made answer: “Yes, but it will be at
least twelve years before she is thirty.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>While Stephen was talking with the
Señora, a gong in an inner room
clanged.</p>

<p>“It is the time for our evening meal, Señor,”
she said, with a pretty little Spanish accent.
After Loring had perjured his soul by swearing
that he was loath to change his occupation for
the pleasure of eating, she smiled at him mockingly,
and led the way into the dining-room.</p>

<p>The Hernandez ranch was the largest in the
Los Andes region, and the house was furnished
and decorated in an elaborate manner. The
walls of the dining-room were hung with gay
pictures, and the table, set for supper, boasted
several pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Señor Hernandez presided at the table with
true Latin hospitality, and Stephen, his previous
protestations to the contrary notwithstanding,
did full justice to the excellent fare,
at the same time keeping up a lively conversation
with the Señora. The men with him ate
vigorously, the only break in their steady eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
being caused by glances at the pretty Mexican
girl who served the meal.</p>

<p>After supper, Stephen and the Señor went
outside, and walked about the ranch, studying
the possibilities of defense in case of trouble.
At Stephen’s suggestion, they led the horses
from the corral, and picketed them behind the
house, as the first thought of any marauders
would undoubtedly be to raid the corral.</p>

<p>Like most adobe houses, the ranch house
consisted of a main building, with two wings
running at right angles, thus enclosing three
sides of a court. All the windows of the ground
floor had iron shutters, fastening on the inside.
The ground about the building was as flat as
a board, and was broken only by the lines of
the irrigation ditches which ran amidst the
alfalfa fields.</p>

<p>“If we station a man to watch upon the roof,”
said Stephen, as they returned to the house,
“it will be all the precaution that we need to
take. On a clear night such as this, a man can
see far in every direction.”</p>

<p>“It will be well,” answered the Señor. “And,
this door here, it is a heavy one. It will be
hard to break down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe that it will come to that,”
laughed Stephen. “I don’t believe that we shall
have any trouble at all.”</p>

<p>“I pray not,” answered Señor Hernandez.
His was not a nature which was exhilarated by
prospective danger.</p>

<p>When they re-entered the main room, Stephen
glanced quickly from the Señora to her husband.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” he said to himself, “how a
little swarthy man like that could have won
such a beauty for a wife. I suppose, though,
that if she really loves him, she does not care
if his ears are a bit like an elephant’s, his eyes
too close together, and his nose as thin as a
razor.” The husband of a pretty woman is not
likely to have his charms exaggerated by other
men.</p>

<p>They spent the evening smoking and talking.
The Señora rolled cigarettes with the greatest
deftness, and the smile with which she administered
the final little pat did much to enhance
the taste of the tobacco.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the Señora rose, and after
calling the servant to light the men to their
rooms, bade them good night.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that Stephen should stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the first watch. He insisted that the Señor,
tired as he was from two sleepless nights of
worry, should not share his vigil.</p>

<p>Having exchanged his carbine for one of his
host’s Winchesters, Loring mounted the ladder
that ran from the hallway of the second story
to the roof. It was a perfect night. The
heavens were glittering with stars, and all was
silent. Not a breath of air came from across
the desert to cool the copings, which were still
warm from the day’s heat.</p>

<p>Stephen leaned his rifle against the chimney,
then felt in his pockets for a little sack of coarse
“Ricorte” which some one in the town had
given to him. He filled his pipe carefully, packing
the tobacco down with his forefinger, till
all was even; then striking a match, he held
it far from him, until the blue flame of the
sulphur burned to a clear yellow. He held the
match to his pipe until the bowl glowed in an
even circle of fire, and the smoke drew through
the stem in rich, full clouds. Then, picking
up his rifle again, he began a careful lookout
over the plain towards the pass.</p>

<p>A fact which greatly facilitates the building
of air castles, is that, unlike most buildings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
they need no foundations. The castles which
Stephen built that night, as he paced up and
down the roof, biting hard on his pipe-stem,
would have done credit to a very good school
of architecture. The general design may be
imagined from the fact that time and time
again he drew from his pocket a little crumpled
envelope, and holding it close to the glow of
his pipe, read and reread it. Once he carried
it to his lips, and with a feeling almost as of
sacrilege, kissed it. Then he turned sharply,
for on the roof behind him he heard light footsteps
and the tinkle of a woman’s laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Señor Loring is a faithful lover,”
exclaimed Pepita, stepping toward him.</p>

<p>Even in the darkness, Stephen felt himself
blushing up to his hair. He stammered, then
laughed: “I plead guilty, but I am not generally
like that.”</p>

<p>“It does no harm,” she murmured softly.
“And the Señorita, does she also care so
much?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” answered Stephen. “The
Señorita does not even know that I care.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think so? Women are not so—how
do you say—? so blind,” laughed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Señora. “But you have not asked me why I
am here, Señor.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Stephen rather bluntly.
In the light of his reveries of the past hour
he felt rather ashamed of the little flirtation
that he had carried on after dinner with the
Señora.</p>

<p>“You need not be embarrassed,” she went
on, laughing at his stiffness. “It was not to
see the gallant Señor that I came, though no
doubt there are many who—”</p>

<p>Loring silenced her with an imploring gesture.</p>

<p>“No, I came to see if all were well. I was
afraid that I heard noises,” she confessed.</p>

<p>“All right, so far,” said Stephen. “I do not
think that we shall have any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Then I will again go down,” she said.</p>

<p>Stephen walked with her over to the ladder,
and bowing low over her hand, whispered a
low “<i lang="es">Buenas noches!</i>” As he helped her to
the ladder, he looked into her eyes rather
curiously. He could not understand their
expression.</p>

<p>When she had her foot upon the uppermost
rung, she said good night to him. Then, as he
turned, she said, half shyly: “The letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Señor; you will watch the <i lang="es">carta</i> of the Señorita
well?”</p>

<p>Laughing softly, yet not altogether gaily, she
ran down the ladder.</p>

<p>“My husband, he is good,” she reflected.
“Ah, very good, but he is as homely as a—monkey.”</p>

<p>Wiping two little tears from the corners of
her eyes, she stepped quickly back into her
room.</p>

<p>The time passed very slowly for Stephen.
The clock in the courtyard below struck two.
His rifle barrel began to feel cold in his fingers,
as he fought against sleep. The night had
grown thicker, and he could no longer see far
out into the distance.</p>

<p>“It will be morning soon,” he thought. “I
don’t believe that the Yaquis mean business
this time.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, his ear caught a low sound.
Then there was a silence. Doubtingly, he
leaned far out over the wall, and listened intently.
Again he heard the sound; again it
ceased. Then once more it arose and became
continuous,—very soft, but insistent, a solid,
dull, irregular thud, as of many hoofs beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
upon soft ground. The blood in Stephen’s face
boiled with quivering excitement. The hoof-beats
came nearer and nearer, then stopped.
The next sound that he heard was a grating
click by the corral, as of some one slipping down
the bars. He thought with lightning rapidity:
“A shot will be the best way to awaken the
men.”</p>

<p>Almost instantly afterwards he saw against
the gray-white of the opposite side of the court
a shadow, then another and another. Kneeling
behind the coping, he covered the leader with
his rifle.</p>

<p>The click of the action as he cocked his Winchester
sounded to him preternaturally loud.
He dropped the muzzle of his rifle a fraction of
an inch until the first shadow drifted across the
sights. He fired, and the shadow dropped.
The flash of his rifle was answered from the
dark by a dozen spurts of flame. All around
him the bullets whined, or clicked against
the dry adobe, sending great chips flying in
all directions. Three times Loring fired,
lying with the butt of his rifle cuddled close
against his cheek. Would the men below
never hear!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>As the vague shapes rushed across the court
for the door with a shrill yell, five knife-like
jets of flame shot from the windows, and the
reports echoed staccato in answer to the fusillade
from the courtyard. The leaders of the
Yaquis had almost reached the shelter of the
doorway, but the angle windows fairly spat fire
as the defenders emptied their repeaters.
Unable to face the withering fire the raiders
wavered, then fell back to the line of the irrigation
ditches, whence they sent a rain of
bullets against the windows of the houses. The
tinkle of breaking glass on all sides was mingled
with the reports of the rifles. The surprise had
been complete for the Yaquis, as they had expected
to find the ranch unprotected.</p>

<p>As soon as this first attack was repulsed,
Stephen ran to the ladder and jumped down
to join the others. His rifle barrel was burning
hot from the rapidity of his fire.</p>

<p>He found the men all gathered in one room.
It was a strange looking group which the
flashes of the rifles revealed in the smoky air,
half dressed, kneeling by the shutters, shooting
viciously out into the darkness, at the blurred
things in the ditches. A bullet whistled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Stephen’s ear as he entered the room, and with
a dull spat buried itself in the plaster behind
him.</p>

<p>“Easy on the cartridges, boys!” he called.
“They may rush again.” His advice was well
called for, as in their excitement the men were
firing wildly.</p>

<p>“It is lucky that there are no windows in the
back of the house,” he exclaimed to Señor
Hernandez.</p>

<p>The latter was engaged in trying to make
himself an inconspicuous target.</p>

<p>There was the sound of footsteps at the door
of the room and a blinding glare of light, as
Pepita entered, carrying a large lamp. Stephen
snatched it from her and hurled it out the
window through the splintered panes. But its
work had been done. One of the men by the
window sobbed, staggered to his feet, and
leaned out into the night, shaking his fist towards
the ditches. Then he fell face downward across
the ledge, where for an instant he was silhouetted
by the last flicker of the lamp below. Loring
flung himself upon him and dragged him back
into the room, but not before the body was
riddled with bullets. Stephen felt the sting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
several as they grazed his clothes, by some
miracle leaving him unhurt.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Dios!</i>” gasped the woman.</p>

<p>“Lie down!” shouted Loring, forcing her
to the floor. Then he took the dead man’s
place by the shutter, and began to fire
methodically.</p>

<p>Encouraged by their success, the Yaquis
again swarmed forward. The whiplike crack
of five Winchesters checked them before they
were within the courtyard.</p>

<p>The black of the night began to turn to gray-blue
with the hint of dawn. The figures in the
ditches stirred, and as they began to run for
their ponies, the defenders fired into them with
telling effect. Then, in contrast to the previous
rattle of shots, came the sound of the hoofs of
a hundred ponies, scampering back up the
trail.</p>

<p>“All over!” called out Stephen. Rising
from his knees, he leaned out of the casement,
and sent one more shot towards the flying
Yaquis. It brought no response.</p>

<p>They carried Haskins, the man who had
been shot, into the next room, and laid him on
the bed. He was quite dead. The Señora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
followed, sobbing. Wildly she turned to Stephen
as he tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>“You, Señor—you do not know what it is
to kill, by madness, by folly.”</p>

<p>“Not know?—I—not know?” Stephen
smiled a smile that was not good to see, as he
broke off.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he thought, “had it left no
trace on him, that haunting vision of two corpses
flung twisted and out of shape on the wreckage
of timber, those two things that had been men
sent out of life by his guilty hand? Had it
not lived with him by night and refused to be
put aside by day? Had they not risen up in the
dark hours and called him by a name from which
he shrank like a blow, and now this woman
told him he could not know what it meant to
kill a man!”</p>

<p>He put his hands in his pockets, bowed his
head, and walked slowly back into the other
room.</p>

<p>The light breaking fast in the eastern sky,
showed a disheveled scene. Mattresses were
scattered on the floor, the bedding was thrown
about the room, all of the windows were smashed.
By each casement was a pile of empty brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
cartridge shells. By one window was a mess of
something red. The air was stale, and filled
with acid-tasting powder smoke.</p>

<p>Loring went downstairs, and slipping back
the bolts on the heavy door, stepped out into the
cool of the early morning. Outside everything
seemed in strange order, compared with the
scene that he had left. He started on a tour
of investigation about the ranch. The ditches
amidst the alfalfa showed no trace of the death-dealing
occupants of an hour before. As he
walked around the corner of an outbuilding, he
stumbled over a body which the Yaquis had
overlooked in their flight. The Indian’s stiff,
square shoes lay with their toes unbending in
the dust. The blue denim of the overalls and
the buckle of the suspenders showed the trademark
of a Chicago firm! A bullet hole was
clean through the middle of the swarthy,
bronze-colored forehead. Even through the
rough clothing, the flat, rangey build of the
man was evident. The hair, falling forward in
the dust, was coarse and black.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” thought Stephen. “He has
ridden on his last raid.”</p>

<p>He walked quietly away from the body, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
went back to the house. “Everything is all
right,” he reported.</p>

<p>Soon the stove was lighted, and coffee boiling.
The men were laughing and telling stories.
The Señor strode up and down, twisting his
little spikes of mustachios, and exclaiming
upon the valor of the defense.</p>

<p>When they sat down to breakfast, there was
a seat too many at the table. Loring thought
of the silent form in the room above, and for
a moment felt weak. Then, shaking off his
depression, he entered into the general hilarity.
Time after time, the servant passed the great
platter of dry <i lang="es">tortillas</i>. The big cakes tasted
delicious to the tired men.</p>

<p>As they finished breakfast, the sound of a
bugle call sent every one to the window. Outside
was a troop of Mexican cavalry, hot on
the trail of the Yaquis. Señor Hernandez invited
the officers to enter, and while he pressed
whisky upon them, gave a voluble account of
the fight. He spoke in such rapid Spanish that
Stephen could understand little; but from the
frequent sweeping gestures, he judged that the
story lost nothing in the telling.</p>

<p>The officers remained but a short while, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
remounted, and rode at a sharp trot towards
the hills.</p>

<p>“I wonder that the government does not
send enough troops to wipe out these fellows.
These cavalry will only drive them back into the
hills, and in a few months they will again swoop
down upon the outlying towns and ranches,
just as they have been doing for the past ten
years,” thought Stephen.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Loring prepared to return to
Los Andes. The others had accepted the invitation
of Señor Hernandez to stay for a few days
as his guests. A spirit of restlessness pervaded
Stephen, and prevented him from remaining.</p>

<p>The Señor was to arrange to send home
Haskins’s body.</p>

<p>“He came from Trinidad, he always said.
Guess he had folks there,” one of the men had
volunteered.</p>

<p>Just as Loring was mounting, Pepita ran
forward, and whispered something to him.</p>

<p>He shook his head in reply.</p>

<p>“Try and see!” was her rejoinder.</p>

<p>The thought which she had put into his head
made the long ride back to Los Andes pass very
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The town had resumed its normal appearance.
The loafers were again stretched upon
the steps of the little stores or on the pavements.
Those who were not rolling cigarettes were comfortably
asleep.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Los Americanos vamos</i>,” was the answer to
Stephen’s inquiries.</p>

<p>After leaving his borrowed horse at a stable,
he wandered idly towards the plaza. Now
that the reaction had come, he felt very tired.
Spying a bench beneath some palm trees, he
stretched himself upon it, and in the security
of him who has nothing, dozed peacefully.</p>

<p>A mosquito, buzzing vapidly about his head,
caused him to exert himself to the extent of a
few useless blows. A wagon, rumbling down
the street, caused him to look up. Then after
these two exhibitions of energy, he fell soundly
asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Towards ten o’clock in the evening
Stephen directed his steps to the railroad
station, and seating himself on a
side-tracked flat car, kicked his heels over the
edge, and smoked his last pipeful of tobacco.
He jangled some keys in his pocket, pretending
to himself that they were money. It was bad
enough, he reflected, to be “broke” in the
States, where he could talk the language; but
here—He looked disconsolately at the throng
of Mexicans who were on the platform. “<i lang="es">Buenos
dies</i>, and <i lang="es">que hora?</i> although I am sure I pronounce
them well, will not take me very far in
the world,” he thought. “It does not matter
much where I go; but I certainly must go somewhere.
I will board the first freight train that
appears, whether it is going north, south, east
or west.”</p>

<p>Having come to this determination, he jumped
down from the car, and walking over to the bulletin
board, ran his finger down the time-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nine o’clock—train for La Punta. Well,
that’s gone. Hello! Here we are—eleven
P. M. express for the City of Mexico. I wonder
what that asterisk means. Oh, yes, Pullmans
only. That would be infinitely more pleasant
than the brake-beams of a freight,” he mused,
“and for me it would be equally cheap.”</p>

<p>Stephen was a novice at the art of “beating
it,” but he possessed two very valuable assets,
a keen observation and a vivid imagination.
Having thus resolved to travel in state, he returned
to his flat car, and set about planning
ways and means. A few minutes of solemn
thought gave him his first conclusion: that at
this time of year the southbound trains would
not be running full.</p>

<p>“Therefore there will be many vacant
berths,” he thought.</p>

<p>A few more puffs upon his pipe gave him the
next link in his plan. “Whether empty, or
full, the Pullman company has all the berths
down.”</p>

<p>Thought number three: “At night they
make long runs, without stopping. Therefore,”
thought Stephen, “once on board, and safely
tucked in an upper berth, I can travel until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
morning without being discovered and thrown
off the train.”</p>

<p>“Now comes the second part of my problem:
how to get on the train and into my berth without
being discovered.” He shut his eyes, and
visualized a train standing at the station.
“Where would the porters stand?” he asked
himself.</p>

<p>He thought hard, and remembered that at
night the porters generally stand at opposite
ends of their cars, so that every alternate set
of steps is unguarded.</p>

<p>“Now,” he reflected, “if the berths are down,
the curtains will be drawn, therefore there
will be little light from the car windows, to
bring me into prominence, and the passengers
will probably be asleep. All will go well, if
the vestibule doors are not locked. But generally
on hot nights they are unlocked. Anyhow,
I must risk it.”</p>

<p>As he mused over his plan giving it the final
touches, the express for the City of Mexico
thundered into the station.</p>

<p>With a grating of brakes, and a squish of
steam, the heavy train sobbed itself to a stop,
the engine dropping from the fire-box a stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of glowing coals between the gleaming steel
rails, and blowing forth steam from the exhaust.</p>

<p>“Here’s my train,” thought Loring. “It
looks very comfortable.”</p>

<p>He slipped his pipe into his pocket, and
stepping back into a shadowy corner, awaited
his opportunity.</p>

<p>From the platform arose an irregular murmur
of voices, such as always attends the arrival of
a train at night. That murmur which, to the
passengers lying half awake, sounds so far away,
and unreal! He heard the bang and thump of
trunks being thrown out of the baggage car.
A party of tourists, weighted down with hand-luggage,
hurried by him. Even as he thought,
the white-jacketed porters stood with their
little steps alternately at the right and left ends
of their respective cars, so that in the long train
there were three unguarded platforms.</p>

<p>A man was rapidly testing and oiling the car
wheels. His torch flared yellow-red against
the greasy brown of the trucks, and made queer
shadows dance on the red varnished surface of
the cars.</p>

<p>Stephen tried to make out the name of the
car nearest to him. The first four gilt letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
showed clearly in the torchlight: “ELDO”—The
man with the torch moved nearer. “ELDORADO,”
spelled Stephen. “Perhaps the
name is a delicate hint to me from Fate.”</p>

<p>The inspector passed on up the train, hitting
ringing blows on the wheels with his short,
heavy mallet. He tested the last car, then
stepped back from the train, swinging his torch
around his head as a signal to the engineer.</p>

<p>“It must be now or never,” thought Loring.
But which platform to try! At that instant,
from the car opposite him, came a great puff
of white steam, for a moment almost obscuring
the steps from view.</p>

<p>Loring darted forward, and jumped upon
the train platform. Anxiously he thrust his
shoulder against the vestibule door. It was
unlocked. As he gained the vestibule, the car
couplings tightened with a jerk, and the train
clumsily started. He took a hasty glance down
the interior of the car. At the opposite end
the porter was closing the vestibule door. The
aisle was clear.</p>

<p>Stephen stepped quickly into the car, pulled
back the curtain of the nearest section, and
stepping on the lower berth, caught hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the curtain bar, and with one pull swung himself
up. In the process, he inadvertently stepped
on the fat man in the lower berth. Stephen
knew that he was fat, because he felt that way.
The man swore sleepily, and twitched the curtain
back into place.</p>

<p>“I think that I won’t put my boots out to be
cleaned to-night,” said Loring to himself. “It
would be tactless.” Then he pulled the blankets
up over him, rolled over close to the far side of
the berth, and fell asleep, lulled by the hum of
the car wheels, pounding southward fifty miles
an hour.</p>

<p>Tired out by his vigil of the night before,
Stephen slept until it was late. He awoke with
a start to find that it was broad daylight.
Sleepily he tried to think where he was. His
eye fell on the dome of polished mahogany above
him, upon the swaying green curtain, and the
swinging bellrope. Then he recalled the situation.
For a few moments he lay back, blissfully
comfortable. His weary muscles were grateful
for the rest. Then he roused himself, and
peered cautiously out from between the curtains.
While he was looking up and down the dusty
stretch of carpet in the aisle, the colored porter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
rapped hard on the woodwork of the lower
berth, and proceeded to awake the occupant.</p>

<p>“Last call for breakfast, number twelve, last
call; half-past nine, sir, half-past nine.”</p>

<p>Stephen curbed a childlike desire to reach
over and pull the kinky hair of the darky.</p>

<p>“I am sure that he would think that I was a
ghost,” he laughed to himself.</p>

<p>He could hear the man below him turn over
heavily, then grunt, and begin to dress.</p>

<p>“I think I also had better arise,” reflected
Loring. He watched the porter until the latter
was at the far end of the car, then dropping his
feet over the edge of the berth he slid out onto
the swaying floor, almost into the arms of the
amazed Pullman conductor, who at that instant
had entered the car.</p>

<p>“Where did you get on?” gasped the brass-buttoned
official. “I didn’t know that there
was an ‘upper’ taken in this car.”</p>

<p>“At Los Andes,” answered Stephen, “I was
rather tired, so I thought I would not bother
you at the time.”</p>

<p>The conductor looked hard at Stephen, and
took in at a glance his ragged clothes, dirty
shoes, and flannel shirt; then he grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was mighty considerate of you,
stranger; now let’s have your ticket. We have
almost reached our next stop.”</p>

<p>Stephen pretended to feel in his pockets,
though he well knew that it was useless. The
other people in the train were beginning to
stare.</p>

<p>“To be put off a train would be far pleasanter
in imagination than in reality,” flashed across
Stephen’s mind.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, now,” repeated the conductor.
“Where is your ticket?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” Loring blurted out.</p>

<p>“Come on, now, no nonsense! fork up!”
insisted the conductor.</p>

<p>“I would gladly, if I had any money,” rejoined
Stephen, then with seeming irrelevancy,
he added: “How far is it from here to the
‘City’?”</p>

<p>“It is about seven hundred miles,” answered
the conductor, “but I am sure you will find it
a delightful walk.”</p>

<p>“Last call for breakfast in the dining-car.
Last call,” again echoed through the car.</p>

<p>“Better hurry, sir,” said the porter, not
realizing the situation, as he passed Stephen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Loring, with a grim smile.
“But I think I will refrain from eating this
morning.”</p>

<p>A rather heavy faced man, who was sitting
near by, laughed audibly. Stephen became
the center of interest for the passengers. For
them, the little scene was a perfect bonanza,
serving to break the monotony of the trip. Loring
was conscious of the stare of many eyes,
about as effectually concealed behind books
and magazines as is an ostrich with its head in
the sand.</p>

<p>“Come out into the vestibule with me!” said
the conductor, rather gruffly. Stephen followed
him in silence. When they were on the platform,
the conductor turned and looked at him
squarely. Loring noticed that there could be
kind lines about the close-set jaw.</p>

<p>“See here,” began the former, “you don’t
look to me like a man who is often working this
sort of game. I guess you must be sort of up
against it, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>Stephen bowed his head slowly, in non-committal
agreement.</p>

<p>“Now I don’t like to see a man down and
out,” went on the conductor, “unless he is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
kind that deserves to be, and you ain’t. Besides,
you’re from the States like I am, and so,
though I’d lose my job if it were found out,
the company is going to set you up to this ride
free.”</p>

<p>Stephen’s face lighted with gratitude, as he
grasped the man’s hand, and thanked him.</p>

<p>“When did you have anything to eat last?”
asked the conductor suddenly.</p>

<p>“Not since yesterday morning,” answered
Stephen.</p>

<p>“Well, you go right into that car” (he pointed
forward with his thumb) “and eat. I’ll make
it all right with the dining-car people.”</p>

<p>“That is too much,” said Loring. “I
can’t”—</p>

<p>The conductor cut him short. “Some time
when you have the money, you can pay me
back. If you don’t ever have it, don’t worry.
No, you mustn’t thank me any more. It is
just that you are an American, and I don’t like
to see a fellow from the States up against it in
this Godforsaken land.”</p>

<p>As Loring walked through the train, his blood
tingled with the pride of race and citizenship,
tingled with the glow that comes or should come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to every man, when he realizes the strength of
the great brotherhood to which he belongs:
realizes that when things are stripped to their
elemental facts, and the veneer of international
courtesy and friendliness removed, he is
standing shoulder to shoulder with his countrymen
against the world.</p>

<p>When at last the train drew into the “City,”
Stephen said a warm good-bye to his benefactor,
then followed the line of passengers out into the
street. With no definite purpose in mind, he
wandered up and down the city, staring idly
into the shop windows. By accident, he found
himself in a great plaza. He was pleased
with the gaiety.</p>

<p>“If it were not for economic distress, I should
be very well off,” he thought. “I must get work
somewhere, and immediately.”</p>

<p>He walked up one of the side streets, looking
at all the signs, hoping that one might give him
a clew. For a long time he saw nothing helpful,
and he was on the brink of discouragement,
when his eye was attracted by a large gilt umbrella
on the next corner, hung out over the
street. Beneath it was a Spanish sign to the
effect that umbrellas could be bought, sold, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
repaired within. In the window was a large
placard: “We speak English.”</p>

<p>“If I were skilful with my hands,” thought
Loring, “I might get a job repairing here; but
I am not skilful with my hands.”</p>

<p>He stood reflecting, his hands deep in his
pockets. An idea soon came to him, for
he had always been more resourceful than
successful.</p>

<p>He walked boldly into the shop, and approached
the proprietor. The man began to
assume the smile with which he welcomed prospective
buyers, noticed Loring’s clothes, and
checking the smile, waited in silence for him to
speak. Stephen, unabashed, smiled in a most
friendly fashion, and a few words of comment
upon the admirable situation of the shop, and
the excellence of the stock, quite won the
owner’s confidence. After a few moments of
conversation, in a guile-free manner he asked:
“And do you do much repairing here?”</p>

<p>“No,” the proprietor admitted, “very little.
Most of my business is to buy and sell.”</p>

<p>“It seems strange that in a big city such
as this there should be no demand for
repairs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen made the statement a question by
the rising inflection. He spoke with the hesitating
assurance which had made so many people
trust him.</p>

<p>The proprietor shook his head in answer:
“No, there is no demand.”</p>

<p>“Is it not that people do not think, perhaps,
do not know of your place?”</p>

<p>“Very likely you are right,” answered the
storekeeper. He was pleased by the stranger’s
interest in his business.</p>

<p>Then Loring played his high card.</p>

<p>“Suppose that you had an active English-speaking
agent, who would go to the offices
and homes of the American and English colony,
and collect umbrellas to be repaired, then would
not your business flourish?”</p>

<p>The shop owner grasped the plan, but not
with both hands.</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” he answered slowly. In dealing
with an American he felt that he must be on
his guard.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Stephen, “I am such a
man, very efficient (Heaven help me!) and reliable
(It won’t!). For a commission, no pay
in advance, but for a commission of say ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
cents for each umbrella, I will collect for you.”
The umbrella man consented half reluctantly.
The matter was soon arranged, and Loring
hastened forth upon his rounds.</p>

<p>By six o’clock, after many strange experiences,
and rebuffs, he had managed to collect ten umbrellas.
Gaudy red, somber black, two green
ones, and one white. All were in advanced
stages of decrepitude. He had pleaded with
the owners to let them be restored, as if each
umbrella had an “inalienable right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>

<p>With his odd collection bundled under his
arms, Loring started on his return to the store.
Greatly pleased with the success of his scheme,
he strolled along talking to himself, and not
noticing where he was going.</p>

<p>Walking in the opposite direction to Loring
on the same sidewalk was another man. His
quick, decisive steps and the slightly deprecating
glance which he cast at any thing of beauty
in the windows of the shops that he passed
proclaimed him an American. The expression
on his face varied from amusement to scorn
as he glanced at things that were different from
those in the States. There was in his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
manner that good-humored toleration of the
best achievements of another nation that marks
the travelling American. The sidewalk was
narrow, and the heavy shoulders of this man
overshadowed half the distance across. He was
covering a good yard at a stride, which was all
the more remarkable as the most of his height
was above the waist. Had he been a girl, his
hair would have been called auburn where it
showed beneath his hat. Being a man, it may
be truthfully said that it matched the bricks of
the building he was passing. His eyes, which
were as round as the portholes of a ship, betokened
a degree of honesty and kindness which
matched well with the general effect of strength
and homeliness given by his whole appearance.
The energy of all his motions was a sharp contrast
to Loring’s lazy stroll. At the second that
he reached Loring, his eyes were uplifted in
wondering curiosity at the bright colors of
the roof tiles. His preoccupation, combined
with Loring’s absorption, made a collision
inevitable. And the inevitable, as usual,
took place.</p>

<p>“I beg your pard—” began Stephen, raising
his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stephen Loring!” exclaimed the stranger.
“Where in the devil did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Baird Radlett!” called Stephen, as if
stupefied.</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly. Radlett was an
old friend of Stephen’s, one who had been an
intimate in the days before Loring’s misfortunes.</p>

<p>“Come on, Steve, we’ll go and get a drink,”
said Radlett.</p>

<p>Loring shook his head. “Not for me,
thanks,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Radlett. “Since when?”
he involuntarily exclaimed. Then for the first
time he took notice of the strange load which
Loring was carrying.</p>

<p>“What on earth, Steve?” he asked, pointing
to the umbrellas.</p>

<p>In the old days Loring had been well off,
Radlett rich, and it hurt Stephen to explain his
abject poverty. He hesitated a moment, then
unblushingly replied:</p>

<p>“Why you see, Baird, I am on a sort of house-party
here, and the weather being fine, I thought
that I would take all the girls’ umbrellas around
to be fixed.”</p>

<p>Radlett stared in amazement, then both broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
into shouts of laughter, as the ridiculousness of
the excuse struck them simultaneously.</p>

<p>“See here, Steve, I know that you are in hard
luck. Come down to my hotel with me, and we
will talk things over,” said Radlett. Putting
his arm affectionately through Loring’s, he
dragged him, protesting, along with him. As
they walked, Stephen explained the matter of
the umbrellas, while Radlett listened amused,
but a bit saddened.</p>

<p>“To think of dear old Steve Loring reduced
to peddling umbrellas!” he said to himself.</p>

<p>On their way, they came to the gilt sign of
the umbrellas.</p>

<p>“I must leave these here,” said Loring.</p>

<p>Radlett tactfully waited outside, while Stephen
entered and deposited the results of his collection.
The proprietor, who, when released from
Stephen’s winning conversation, had begun to
feel rather worried, was surprised and delighted
at the success of the mission. He opened the
cash drawer, and handed to Stephen a silver
dollar. Stephen wrote down the addresses of
the umbrella owners, then with his new earned
dollar clinking lovingly against the keys in his
pocket, he rejoined Radlett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked briskly to the hotel where Radlett
was staying, and stepping into the smoking
room, were soon comfortably ensconced in two
big leather armchairs, placed in an out-of-the-way
corner of the room.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Radlett pounded upon the nickel bell
on the smoking table, and ordered two
cigars. Stephen bit the end of his cigar
hastily, while Radlett produced a clipper from
his pocket, and carefully cut the end of his.
These unconscious actions portrayed well the
differences in their characters. Drawing a match
from the white earthenware holder, Baird
scratched it on the rough surface, and then held
the light to Stephen’s cigar.</p>

<p>“Mine is lighted, thank you, Baird,” said
Loring, and through blue circles of smoke he
watched Radlett light his own cigar.</p>

<p>“I had almost forgotten what a stocky old
brute Baird was,” he mused. “I do not think,
though, that I could ever forget that dear old
face. Of all the faces that I ever knew his is
the homeliest, and the kindest! If he poked
that long jaw of his out at me, and looked at me
with those honest eyes, he might tell me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
black was white, and I should fight the man
who said that it was not true.”</p>

<p>Radlett also utilized those first moments of
silence brought about by a good cigar, an old
friend, and a comfortable chair, to make a few
observations of his own.</p>

<p>“In five years, Steve has changed a great
deal,” he thought. “Five years of failure, and
drifting, such as I judge these to have been,
leave their mark on any man, definitely and indefinitely.
Imagine Loring, the fastidious, in
those clothes five years ago! And then the old
frank manner has become a bit hesitant. He
seems always on the defensive. Poor old chap,
he must have had some pretty hard blows. The
old light in his eyes is no longer there; but after
all he has that same quality of winning appeal,
of humor and of latent strength, which
nothing can obliterate, which always has made
and always will make every one who knows
him hope for the best, and pardon the worst.”
At the conclusion of his reflections, Baird’s
eyes were damp.</p>

<p>Stephen smoked slowly, as one would sip
a rare old wine. Then, taking the cigar from
his mouth, he held it before his eyes, twirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the label slowly around, and looking at it
appreciatively.</p>

<p>“It is eleven months since I smoked a good
cigar, Baird; perhaps you can guess how this
one tastes to me,” said Loring softly, almost as
if talking to himself. Then he relapsed again
into silence.</p>

<p>Radlett puffed vigorously on his cigar, then
said: “Steve, it is your own fault that you are
not smoking good cigars all the time.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” answered Loring; “but the
fact remains, and eleven months is a long time
out of one’s life to lose such happiness.”</p>

<p>“The last time that I heard of you, you were
in Chicago,” remarked Radlett. “Some one
told me that you had a good position there.
What happened to you?”</p>

<p>“Fired,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>“Did you deserve to be?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>One of the things that Loring’s friends held
dearest in him was the fact that he never
shirked the truth in the matter of his delinquencies.
His own word on the matter was
final. In the old days Loring’s deficiencies had
been among his most charming attributes. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had always spoken hopefully of “When he
buckles down.” Now the “When he will,”
had become “Now that he has not,” and his
deficiencies were not so charming.</p>

<p>Radlett smoked on imperturbably. When
he again spoke, his voice was thick with smoke.</p>

<p>“What was your last position?”</p>

<p>“Hoist engineer, Quentin Mining Company.”</p>

<p>Again the query: “Why did you leave?”</p>

<p>“Fired,” repeated Stephen, flushing savagely.
Then looking Radlett in the eyes, he added:
“I was drunk, and through my fault two men
were killed.”</p>

<p>Leaning forward, Radlett laid his hand on
Loring’s shoulder, and gripped it tightly with
his strong fingers.</p>

<p>“Steve, old man, I am sorry for you. I know
what this must mean to you. You were always
the most kind-hearted fellow on earth, and I
can see how this has crushed and saddened
you. I’m—I’m damned sorry—but, Steve,
you needed it. It will be the making of you,
Steve. We have all been wanting to help you,
and we could not; you would not let us. You
have lost almost everything in the world,—your
money, your position, your family. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
have lost prize after prize which you might have
won; and all these things have not held you.
You still had that quality of drifting. You used
to think,—I remember well how we used to
talk it over,—that love would hold a man.
It won’t. If you have tried it, you know”—Loring
breathed hard—“if you have not,
then you have been spared one more blow.
You never had, or could have had, religion; I
don’t know what that might have done for you.”
Radlett was speaking fast now, and though he
struck hard, Loring never flinched.</p>

<p>“You always knew that you were hurting
yourself by what you did; but that did not
check you,” went on Radlett. “You had, I
remember, a creed of ethics in which, so you
said, you logically believed. You know how
much good that has done you.</p>

<p>“Steve, I am as sorry for you as if you were
myself—yes, sorrier.” In the intensity of
their grasp, his fingers almost crushed Loring’s
shoulder. “I know what it seems to you, the
feeling of guilt, and of remorse; but you deserved
it and you needed it. The one thing
that could have stopped your drifting was to
find that your destiny and actions are inextricably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
tangled with those of other men. Now
that you have learned that by drifting you may
sink other ships, you won’t drift. I know you,
Steve, and I swear it. This has been your salvation.”
Radlett stopped short, and sank back
into his chair.</p>

<p>Stephen sat looking sternly into the smoke.
There were deep lines beneath his eyes, showing
dark against his pallor, for so great was the
tumult within him that even through his heavy
tan his face showed white. When he spoke
it was as a man who opens his mouth, and does
not know whether the words that he speaks are
loud or soft.</p>

<p>“You are right, Baird. I was wrong, and
Baird, I’ve thrown over everything in the world
that I cared about. There was a girl, Baird;
you were right about that, too. She believed
in me, even though she did not care. I cared
for her more than for anything that I have
ever dreamed of in the world. She was everything
to me, Baird, and I promised her that I
would make good. I broke my word. It was
the only thing that I had not broken before.
Well, my love for her did not check me.</p>

<p>“But since that—that—murder,” he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
now from deep in his chest, “I have gripped
myself; I have found myself. I am going to
work up again, Baird. I can,—I am on the up
grade. I am sure of it. It is a hard struggle,
but the fight of it makes it all the more worth
while. It will be hard, and it will take time;
but I can do it.”</p>

<p>Radlett stared out of the window for a few
moments, as though deeply absorbed in watching
a passing carriage. Letting his eyes travel
back to Loring, he asked: “Did you ever
hear of the Kay mine? I think that it was
situated near where you were last working.”</p>

<p>Stephen nodded. He was relieved at the
change from the tenseness of the conversation,
and a little ashamed of the emotion which he
had shown. “Yes,” he answered, “it was only
fifteen or twenty miles from Quentin. An English
syndicate bought it some time ago. They
brought out polo ponies, dog-carts, and heaven
knows what besides, to gladden their hearts
while in exile. I rode there only a few weeks
ago, and looked over the place. The mine has
been shut down for a year. It is a wonder that
they were ever able to open it in the first place,
with all the nonsense that they had. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
whom I saw there told me that the English
managers had spent two days in arguing where
to put the ‘baths in the houses of the tenantry.’
I hear that the mine has just been sold again.”</p>

<p>Radlett grinned from ear to ear at the thought
of the effect on the community of a remark about
the “tenantry.”</p>

<p>“Still,” went on Loring, “almost everybody
says that it is a very rich property, and would
have paid well if it had only been worked
properly. The indications were very good for
a big vein.”</p>

<p>Radlett beat a tattoo with his fingers on the
arms of his chair.</p>

<p>“I have just bought the mine,” he said.</p>

<p>Stephen looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he said, “that you were only
interested in railroads.”</p>

<p>“That is true; but this is a sort of ‘flyer.’
I had the chance to buy the property very
cheaply, and the expert whom I sent to look at
it reported it as good, if it were properly managed.
I must get as manager a man whom I
can absolutely trust, as I shall have no time to
supervise the work personally. Stephen, will
you take the position?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Loring sat up straight in his chair.</p>

<p>“I am not the man for the place,” he said;
“I know very little about mining, and besides—”</p>

<p>“Leave out the ‘besides’,” answered Radlett.
“That is over with. I would trust you now as
soon as any man living. As for the knowledge
of mining, you will not require any. There is
a good mine foreman there who can attend to
that. What I want is a man to organize and
run the plant, to make it a paying producer.
It needs a man who understands men, more
than a man who understands mining. The ore
is there. The men to get the ore will be there;
but there must be a head for the whole system.
You know, better than I do, that a new mine
means a new community to be governed. It
needs a man who will see that for every copper
cent that goes into the ground, two copper cents
come out, a man who will see that the machinery
which is ordered arrives on time. It
needs a man who will pick the right subordinates
and will give them pride in their work.
It needs a man who will get the labor, and
keep it there. That is what I want you for,
Steve. You can do the work. Now will you?”</p>

<p>Two voices seemed to whisper in Loring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
One was of pride, the other was of pride in
himself. The voice of pride whispered: “He
is your friend, and is offering this to you from
charity.” The other voice, aggressive and self-reliant,
whispered: “You can do the work
well. It needs a <em>man</em>, and you are capable of
doing it.”</p>

<p>“Baird,” he said brokenly, “I will. I can’t
thank you; it is far too big a chance to be acknowledged
by mere thanks. But I will do my
best for you, and if I fail, it will be because I
am not a big enough man, and not because I
have not tried.”</p>

<p>“The thanks will be from me to you, when
the Kay is the biggest producer in Pinal County,”
responded Radlett. “If you do your best, it
will be the best that can be done. Don’t think
that it is from friendship that I offer you this.
I always keep friendship and business apart,
and I am offering this to you because you are
the man that I need.” Radlett took a large
leather covered note-book from his pocket.</p>

<p>“Here are the details of the proposition,”
he said, and for almost an hour he read aloud
a list of figures and estimates. Loring listened,
keenly alert, and questioned and criticised with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
an insight which surprised Radlett, who several
times looked up in approval at some suggestion.
When he had finished, he closed the book, and
said: “The acting manager will start you on
your work. The mine was opened last week,
but everything there is still at sixes and sevens.
When do you think that you can start north?”</p>

<p>“I will take the eleven o’clock train to-night,”
answered Stephen, decidedly, “only—”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Baird, in a matter of
fact manner, “you had better draw your first
month’s salary in advance. There will be a
great many things that you need to get.” He
wrote a check and gave it to Loring. “They
will cash this for us at the office. I shall telegraph
to-night to the mine, telling them to
expect you; also to the company in Tucson,
telling them to honor your drafts.”</p>

<p>Radlett rose and looked at his watch. “It is
eight o’clock and I am as hungry as a bear,
and,” he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, “if
you can leave that house-party of yours, where
the girls have such charming umbrellas, we
might dine together before you start.”</p>

<p>They entered the dining-room, where the
orchestra was playing gaily, and settled themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
at a table glowingly lighted with candles
under softened shades.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t this seem like old times, Steve?”
said Radlett, while he carved the big planked
steak which they had ordered. Throughout
the meal, time and again the phrase: “Do you
remember?” was repeated, recalling hosts of
memories, both sad and gay. The intimacy
between Radlett and Loring had been of such
depth and woven with so many bonds that the
years in which they had been separated made
no difference in their complete companionship.
They were not forced to fall back on the past
on account of lack of sympathy and mutual
interest in the present, as is so often the case;
but rather they looked backward as one might
open a much loved book, the interest of which
increases as the covers wear out, and in which
the delight is intensified when some congenial
soul has shared its moods, and its laughter.
Through all the conversation, Radlett, with an
inborn tact unexpected in a man whose manner
was so bluff, skilfully recalled Stephen’s successes,
and dwelt upon them in an endeavor to
raise that self-confidence in Loring which had
been shaken to its core. Stephen’s failures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
recalled by Stephen himself, whose recollection
of them was undimmed though his perspective
on them had changed. So quickly did the time
pass that it was with a start that they both
heard the clock in the hall outside strike ten,
in a deliberate, impersonal fashion. In answer
to a question from Radlett, Loring shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No, I have no preparations to make. If
the city with no history is happy, then certainly
the person with no possessions to bother him
should be content.”</p>

<p>So they smoked in quiet companionship until
it was time to leave for the station. Baird saw
Loring on board the train, and they parted
after a silent, firm handshake, which gave
strength to one and conviction to the other.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>In six months after Loring had taken charge,
the Kay mine was producing on a paying
basis. What those six months had accomplished
was little short of marvelous. At the
time of the arrival of the new manager, everything
had been in an extreme state of disorganization.
Unused machinery stood uncovered
and rusting. The pumps were hardly more
than holding the water in the shafts. No new
timbering had been put in place to supplant
the old, which was dangerously rotten. The
costly electric lighting plant had been almost
ruined by neglect. Discord had been reigning
between the various heads of departments, and
discord in a community in which there is no
recreation, and from which there is no way of
escape, is a dangerous element.</p>

<p>When Loring had assumed control, in explanation
of failures each worker had murmured
complaints of others. At the mess there
had been gloomy silence, in contrast to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
joviality which had prevailed at the old mess
in Quentin. Distrusted and disliked, Loring
had firmly pursued his course until that course
was justified, and the criticism and hatred had
turned to respect and admiration. He had
worked night and day, attending to everything
himself. Loring was tireless in his enthusiasm,
and he had inspired the men under him to do
their work better than they knew how. The
result was that by this time, the system of a well-built
machine had supplanted the previous chaos.
And though it was far from a perfect machine,
each day was adding to its efficiency.</p>

<p>The nervous irritability of the mess had
been relieved by the arrival of an old friend.
One day Hop Wah had drifted into Stephen’s
office and after announcing solemnly: “Me
canned, too,” had stood waiting expectantly
until Loring had ordered him installed as
assistant cook in the company eating-house.
Within a week after this the meals had become
joyous occasions. Wah would dance from man
to man as he served the meals, murmuring insults
which pleased even the insulted, and provoked
roars of laughter at the victim’s expense.
When he had some particularly bold insult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
deliver, he would sing it from the kitchen window.
The singing lent impersonality and the
distance safety. Soon the refrain and interlude
of his old song, “La, la, boom, boom,” were as
well known, and as popular in Kay, as they
had been in Quentin.</p>

<p>Radlett had told Loring that there would
be much work for him to do, and he had not
been guilty of exaggeration. Night after night
the electric light beneath the green tin reflector
in the office had burned until well into the morning.
Then a watcher might have seen it go out
suddenly, before a tired man turned the key in
the office door.</p>

<p>The increase of efficiency in the work at the
Kay mine was due to one thing,—the ceaseless
vigilance of Stephen Loring, and the outward
circumstances were only the manifestation
of the changed conditions within himself. One
who had known Loring, the failure, would
scarcely have recognized Loring, the success.
The chin line no longer drooped, his smile
showed honest pride in the goodness of his
work, his movements were alert, his head thrown
back. His skin was ruddy and his eyes clear,
yet the marks about his mouth showed traces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the struggle through which he had passed,
and there were new lines of care lying in furrows
across his forehead. He had aged under responsibility,
and something of the old, lazy
charm which had endeared him to his friends
was gone; but a stranger looking at him would
have appreciated at once that here was a man
of force, one who meant to be master, and who
was fitted to be.</p>

<p>It is possible that the change in his dress contributed
as much as the more subtle developments,
for Loring, in his blue suit, soft white
shirt, and well-oiled tan boots, was a very different
looking man from the shabbily clothed
wanderer who had sought work last year in
Phœnix.</p>

<p>On one autumn afternoon Stephen sat at
the desk in his office, engaged in dictating a
report to the directors of the Company. Above
the rattle and click of the typewriter his voice
rose and fell monotonously: “The construction
work alone is behind. Within the workings
three new stopes have been opened since
last report, at positions marked on the enclosed
print. The ore in these has been running high,
averaging”—(he paused and glanced at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
assayers’ report lying on the table beside him)
“averaging twelve per cent copper. If the contact
vein continues to run in its present direction,
the ore from the new stopes which we are opening
may be reached cheaply by means of winzes
from the three hundred foot level.” Loring
verified this carefully from the foreman’s report,
then nodded to the stenographer to proceed.
“The cost of production has been reduced five
per cent in the last month. If the present favorable
prices for the coke continue, I hope to
reduce this still more. I enclose for the first time
a detailed statement of expense distributed per
department, made possible by the new system
of bookkeeping which has been adopted.” Here
he paused. “That is all for the present,” he said.</p>

<p>Then he picked up the construction report
and with a frown reread it. “That is bad
work,” he murmured. “With all the men whom
Fitz had under him, he should have done better,
and accomplished more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reade!” he called to the stenographer
who had gone into the back room, “come back
here! I have something to add to that report.”</p>

<p>The stenographer came in, and again took
his place before the typewriter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Owing to the slowness of the work on the
exterior construction, I have found it necessary
to dispense with the services of Mr. Fitz.”</p>

<p>Reade looked up in surprise. “Are you
going to ‘can’ him?”</p>

<p>Stephen made no answer, but continued to
dictate: “I have secured the services of a very
good man, who until recently has been at the
head of that work in the Quentin Mining Company
and who, I think, will fill the position very
satisfactorily.” “That is all, Reade.”</p>

<p>The stenographer left the room, whistling
softly. “He sure acts with precision,” murmured
Reade, as he closed the door. “When
Fitz answered back at mess the other night, I
knew he’d get into trouble. The Boss never
speaks twice, and now that the men understand
his ways, he don’t need to.”</p>

<p>A short half-hour after Loring had finished
his letter the stage from the northward drew
up outside the office door, and a passenger
descended from it. Loring opened the window,
looked out, and recognized his old friend
McKay.</p>

<p>“Prompt as usual!” thought Loring. “I did
not expect him until to-morrow or the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
after; but I like his coming so soon. Promptness
means efficiency.”</p>

<p>Loring smiled when he heard McKay tell
the driver to charge the trip to the Company.
“Mac has not much to learn of business methods
in the west,” Loring chuckled, as he hastened
to resume his seat at the desk. A little later he
heard a thump, as McKay dropped his bag on
the porch, and then he heard him asking for
the manager. Some one directed the stranger
to the office, and Loring heard the creak of his
boots on the stairs.</p>

<p>Stephen, for he had a streak of vanity
in his nature, lighted a cigar, and pretended
to be very busy over some papers. After a
moment he looked up, to find McKay staring
in such open-mouthed astonishment that it
seemed as if his teeth were in danger of falling
back down his throat.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned!” he finally ejaculated.
“What are <em>you</em> doing here?”</p>

<p>“I am the manager,” said Stephen in a
dignified manner. Then he could keep a sober
face no longer, and burst into a laugh, in which
McKay, though in a dazed and uncertain
manner, joined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen jumped up from his chair and
shook hands with his old boss. McKay continued
to swing his arm up and down, as
though this grip were his one hold upon the
world of realities.</p>

<p>“You! How on earth did it happen? You
must have been a heap wiser than I thought!”
exclaimed McKay.</p>

<p>The only danger of being thought wise is
that one is tempted to prove it; but Stephen
safely avoided this danger.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, Mac,” he answered, “here I am
and here I hope I’ll remain, and there is a lot
of work for you to do here. Things have been
allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that it
takes more time to rebuild than it must have
taken to construct the whole plant. Fortunately
we have the original plans designed by the
people who had opened the mine, and though
they are no key to what has been done, they
give a pretty good idea of what was meant to
be done.” As he spoke he pulled a roll of blue
prints out from the desk drawer, and drawing
up a chair beside him for McKay, he started
to outline the work.</p>

<p>As he watched the unerring way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
McKay’s clumsily shaped finger followed the
designs, stopping at each questionable point
and rubbing back and forth over it with the
determined questioning of a hand competent
to remedy defects, Loring thanked heaven for
the fact that the Quentin Company, their rush
of early work over, had parted with such a
man. The very twitching of the corners of
McKay’s mustache, as he pored over the
papers, showed a personality teeming with success
and energy. After an hour of hard work
Stephen pushed back his chair from the desk
and rolled up the prints.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Mac,” he said, “that you are
going to be very busy here. You see I know
how good a man you are. But I also realize
that after your journey you must eat, and that
you will want to see your quarters.”</p>

<p>He called Reade into the room and introduced
him. “Take Mr. McKay and show him
where he is to live. Put him in that new shack
on the right-hand side of the road.” With a
sudden recollection of McKay’s treatment of
him on that first night at Quentin, Stephen
went on with a broad grin: “To-night I will
send you over some blankets. You can pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
for them out of your first month’s pay, and
to-morrow I will let you have an old straw
hat of mine.”</p>

<p>McKay smiled sheepishly, as he stood twirling
his rusty black felt hat in his fingers. Accustomed
as he was to the sudden changes which
Arizona brings about in men’s fortunes, Loring’s
meteoric rise was too great a problem for
him to solve. He could not adjust himself to
the miraculous change which had been wrought
in the life of the man before him. He could
only stand speechless and gaze at the marvel,
and then drop his eyes again to the baggy
knees of his best trousers.</p>

<p>Stephen took pity on him in his bewilderment
and interrupted his reflections: “If you can
start in to work after lunch, I will have Mr.
Fitz, the man who is leaving, show you what
little he has done. You had better take a microscope
to see it with.”</p>

<p>McKay followed Reade out of the office, his
efficient, right-angled and non-complex mind
in a whirl.</p>

<p>“<em>Steve Loring</em>, manager of the Kay mine!
I certainly will be damned. <em>Him</em> running all
this!” He gazed stupefied at the ordered confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of the busy camp before him. “<em>Steve
Loring!</em> Phew!”</p>

<p>And all the time the man of whom McKay
was thinking with admiring envy sat before
his desk, his head sunk upon his folded arms
in an attitude of profound dejection.</p>

<p>To McKay, Loring seemed to have reached
the highest level of the up grade in being the
manager of a successful mine. What more
could any man wish? But to Loring all that
he had achieved was as nothing.</p>

<p>The sight of McKay had brought back with
photographic vividness all the familiar things
and scenes of the old days at Quentin,—the
smelter, the dip in the hills, the hoist, “<i lang="es">Muy
Bueno</i>,” and then, in spite of himself, above
them all rose the face of Jean Cameron, Jean
as she had looked bending over his cot in the
hospital with the sheaf of flowers across her
arm, Jean smiling at him as she passed the
hoist, Jean stretching out her hand to him on
that never-to-be-forgotten ride through the soft
Arizona night.</p>

<p>With a sudden pang he realized that all success
would be as dust and ashes unless he could
bring it to her and say: “Whatever I have won,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
it was all for you. My only pride is that whether
you ever know it or not, I have at last justified
your faith in me. Oh, Jean,” he murmured,
“it is not success or power or money that I want.
It is you, dear, you, you, you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>At four o’clock that afternoon, since it
was Saturday, the men were paid off
for the week. No pay day will ever be
satisfactory to the recipients until that happy
state of affairs is reached when each man
himself decides on the amount which is due
him. Even then there will be some who will
leave the pay-window with the discontented
feeling that they have cheated themselves.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper, from his grated window,
gave out the pay checks to the line of Mexican
laborers who, displaying their brass number
tags, passed before him. He kept up a running
fire of argument. Over and over he was
obliged to explain the amounts of the checks.</p>

<p>“The mess bill comes out of you.”</p>

<p>“You had twenty dollars’ worth of coupons
at the store.”</p>

<p>“No, you only worked five days this week.”</p>

<p>“Hospital fee is twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>These were fair samples of the innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
arguments which he was compelled to go
through with every week. And in spite of all
explanations, the poor miners would walk
away from the window, looking with dejected,
unbelieving eyes at the small figures of their
checks. Men of this class can never realize
that if out of wages of ninety dollars a month
they spend seventy-five for food and store coupons,
the balance due to them is not ninety
dollars, but fifteen.</p>

<p>As usual on pay day afternoon, in the road
before the office, little groups of men were
arguing excitedly among themselves, discussing
the manner in which they were “cheated.”
The dejected droop of their shoulders was accentuated
by the quick, jerky movements of
their arms as they gesticulated.</p>

<p>Knowlton, the deputy sheriff, who was assigned
to Kay, sat on the steps before the office
door. He was rolling a cigarette, seemingly
unconscious of the noisy crowd. But pay day
was always likely to cause trouble, and he was
prepared for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="440" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“No one quite dared to lead an attack upon Knowlton, who
stood his ground beside the body.” <a href="#Page_241"><i>Page 241</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The group of excited men augmented fast,
as little knots of miners were paid off, and
found awaiting them a willing audience of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
grievances. A word will fire a crowd of this
kind as quickly as a fuse will set off a charge
of giant powder.</p>

<p>Knowlton watched them closely, out of the
corner of his eye. He saw one of the leaders
in the discussion stoop down and pick up a
large rock.</p>

<p>“Hey, Rigas! Drop that, quick!” he
shouted.</p>

<p>For answer the rock crashed through the
glass of the office window.</p>

<p>Knowlton waded into the midst of the crowd,
and seized Rigas by the collar, almost hurling
him off his feet. His rough tactics generally
overawed his prisoners, but Rigas had been
drinking, and fought. The crowd began to
close in.</p>

<p>Knowlton dropped his hand to the point
where the suspenders joined his belt and
whipped out his “automatic.” Raising it
in the air, he swung it down with all his
strength upon Rigas’s head. There was a
stunning report, and the miner lay upon the
ground, with a hole two inches wide through
his forehead. The crowd, muttering angry
curses, drew back. No one quite dared to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
an attack upon Knowlton, who stood his ground
beside the body, his still smoking gun in his
hand. The camp doctor came up on the run,
having heard the sound of the report. Kneeling
beside the body, he gave short and incisive
directions.</p>

<p>“Valrigo, Peres, Gonzales, and Escallerra;
you four carry him over to the hospital!”</p>

<p>The four men whom he had designated bent
over and clumsily raised the inanimate body.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the doctor, “don’t let his
head hang back. Here, Valencella! Come
and hold up his head. That is right. Now
slowly with him, boys; easy, don’t jolt him!”</p>

<p>The doctor walked beside the bearers, his
hand on Rigas’s heart, which for a wonder was
still beating. Behind them fell in a sullen,
straggling, pushing procession of the other men,
watching the blood drip from Rigas’s head.</p>

<p>Then Knowlton turned, and walked slowly
into the office. As he entered, the volume of
curses changed from a mutter to a roar. He
found Loring on his knees, locking the combination
of the safe.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Loring, I’ve done it now. I’ve
killed Rigas. These damned automatics! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
can beat a man over the head for a week with
a Colt without its going off.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” said Stephen calmly, rising from
his knees. “But the character of Rigas was not
such that he will be a great loss to the world.
He was always causing some sort of mischief.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t Rigas that I am worrying about,”
said the deputy. “It’s the rest of them.”</p>

<p>“How long can you hold them in check?”
asked Stephen.</p>

<p>“If they were sober, I could hold them until
hell froze, but they have just been paid off,
and by night they will all be drunk. Then there
will be trouble. It has been brewin’ for a week.
Some agitator chap has been talking it up to
them about the way the Company was stealing
from them. I don’t jest know what we had
better do,” he concluded, while he fingered
his gun nervously, and looked to Loring for
guidance.</p>

<p>“Rigas is dead, you said?” asked Stephen.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly. He might as well be,
though. A forty-five calibre hole through your
head ain’t healthy. If he ain’t dead now, he
won’t live more than a few hours. And when
he does die—!” Knowlton broke off gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it, Mr.
Loring?”</p>

<p>“We can only wait,” answered Loring.
“We must not let them see that we are anxious.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you going to do <em>nothing</em>?” Knowlton
looked at Loring in perfect amazement.</p>

<p>Stephen smiled, and shook his head. “No,
I am going to supper. I would advise you to
eat at the mess to-night, instead of at your shack.
I am afraid that at present you are not exactly
popular.”</p>

<p>He walked off towards the eating-house,
while Knowlton stood looking after him blankly.</p>

<p>“He don’t realize that in about three hours
after those men get to drinking, the Kay mine
won’t exist. If we had a real man in charge
here, we might do something about it. He
thinks, I suppose, that because the men like
him there won’t be trouble. Hell! and I used
to think he had sense!” Knowlton almost
snorted in his rage.</p>

<p>At supper every man was keyed to a high
pitch of excitement. There were only about
twenty white men in camp, and though they
were well armed, the Mexicans outnumbered
them more than fifteen to one. Stephen alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
refrained from joining in the flurry of question
and conjecture which whirled about the table.
Although he seemed unmoved, a close observer
would have noticed that he gripped his knife
and fork almost as if they had been weapons.
Wah slid his plate of soup before him, at the
same time patting him on the shoulder with
affectionate interest.</p>

<p>“Me bludder like one owl,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hey, Wah, this soup is rotten!” called a
young fellow from the end of the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, lubbly, lubbly soup!” chanted Wah.
“Lubbly, me bludder, lubbly.”</p>

<p>“I’m not your bludder, Wah,” answered the
man politely. “I would rather have an ape for
a brother than you.”</p>

<p>“You me bludder, allee samee, allee samee.”
Saying which, Wah disappeared into the kitchen,
only to stick his head a moment later through
the connecting window, and call: “Oh, you
pig-faced Swede, Oh, you pig-faced Swede! La,
la, boom, boom!”</p>

<p>But even Wah was unable to break the tension
that surrounded the supper. As the men
were lighting their pipes at the close of the meal,
from the gulch behind the camp where were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the saloons, came the sound of a fusillade of
shots and a burst of shrill yelling.</p>

<p>“The game is on,” thought Loring.</p>

<p>As the noise outside became louder, Stephen
said to the men: “I want all you fellows to
get your guns and go over into the office to
guard the safe. Go as quietly as you can so
as not to stir things up. Keep quiet in there
and don’t shoot unless you are compelled to.
We have just issued some new stock, and if
there is news of any fighting here the value will
go all to pieces. We must just wait, and keep
quiet. Remember a fight means almost ruin,
and we have got to avoid it.”</p>

<p>Knowlton looked quickly over to McKay,
and nodded. Both were experienced men,
and they knew that now was no time to think
of stock values, but of actually saving the mine,
and the lives of the white men there. They
knew that serious trouble was intended, as
since the shooting, every outlet of the camp had
been guarded by Mexicans. They knew that
the only chance, not for avoiding a fight, but
for avoiding a massacre, lay in an immediate
attack on the Mexicans, before they were completely
out of hand. And Loring was thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of stock values! Still, they remembered that
he was inexperienced, and they set down to
indecision what seemed like criminal folly.
As for McKay, he had known Loring to fall
once before, and he was not hopeful for the
outcome.</p>

<p>“Knowlton,” continued Loring, “you had
better stay here with me. It won’t do for the
miners to think that you are hidden.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t be,” exclaimed Knowlton
decisively. “There is only one thing in this
world that I am afraid of, and that is a fool!”</p>

<p>The men hurried to their tents to procure
their firearms. From the window of the mess
Stephen watched them, as one by one they
returned and slipped into the darkened office.
Then he stepped out on the porch, and seated
himself beneath the full glare of the hanging
electric light. Knowlton, with a dogged expression
on his face, seated himself on the steps.
Another man came and joined them. It was
McKay.</p>

<p>“Let me stay here with you, Steve,” he said
gruffly.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” replied Stephen. Then he
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Sitting with his watch beside him on the arm
of the chair, and smoking furiously, his eye
traveled to Knowlton, and dwelt on the brown
oiled butt of the latter’s “automatic,” an odd-shaped
lump against the white of his shirt.</p>

<p>“That was the first time I ever killed a man
by accident,” murmured Knowlton, half to
himself. “The Doc said after supper that
Rigas might possibly live another hour.”</p>

<p>“An hour, did you say?” asked Loring.
Then again he sat in silence, staring intently
at his watch.</p>

<p>“Quarter past eight. He has lived more
than an hour since supper.”</p>

<p>From the valley, seven miles away, came
softly the whistle of the evening train. The
noise in camp was continually increasing in
volume. Groups of miners went by the mess
shouting, singing, and whooping derisively.
Every now and then the babel of voices was
punctuated by shots fired in rapid succession
as some one emptied his gun in the air.</p>

<p>By the hospital a silent group was waiting,
waiting for Rigas to die.</p>

<p>The men on the porch watched that sinister
mass with apprehension. The effect was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
more suggestive than that of the noisier portion
of the camp.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mass of men by the hospital
stirred, heaved, and moved. From a hundred
throats came a dull roar.</p>

<p>“Rigas is dead,” said Loring, shutting his
watch with a snap.</p>

<p>The crowd of men by the hospital began to
roll towards the mess. As a huge swell rolls in
from the sea, so the black mass, swaying, rising,
falling, swept on. As it drew nearer, the white
of the men’s faces stood out in the glare of the
electric lights even as the foam upon that
wave.</p>

<p>“Put out the porch lights!” yelled Knowlton.</p>

<p>“I am manager here, and they stay lit,”
shouted Loring back to him.</p>

<p>Even as the surf curls before breaking and
sweeping up the beach, so the wave of men
seemed to rise and draw itself together, before
surging up the steps.</p>

<p>Stephen had stepped forward to the edge of
the steps in front of Knowlton. He raised his
fist for silence, and such was the compelling
force in his eyes that for a moment he was
obeyed. But as he started to speak, a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
hiss arose from the crowd, like the sound of
escaping steam from some giant locomotive.
Loring gripped the railing of the porch hard,
and again shouted something.</p>

<p>“God, he’s crazy!” yelled Knowlton to
McKay. “He is going to try and argue.”
Knowlton’s hand lay tightly on the gun in his
belt.</p>

<p>“Steve has lost his head again,” thought
McKay bitterly. “I might have known that
he didn’t have the stuff in him.”</p>

<p>A bottle whizzed by Loring’s ear, breaking
with a crash against the wall behind him. For
an instant the sound of breaking glass caught
the attention of the crowd.</p>

<p>“You want the money in the safe?” shouted
Loring.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Sí</i>, <i lang="es">sí</i>, yes, <i lang="es">sí</i>, yes, <i lang="es">sí</i>!” roared the crowd, in
a mixture of two languages.</p>

<p>The sound lulled for a second. Stephen
waved his keys in the air. “You shall have it.”</p>

<p>The shouting was wilder than before, and
echoed from end to end of the camp.</p>

<p>“Coward!” moaned McKay, sickened by
such an exhibition. Some one in the crowd
fired at Loring, luckily with drunken aim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
The bullet kicked up the dust at the foot of
the steps. Knowlton jumped to his feet, and
leveled his gun at the crowd.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” roared Stephen. Not knowing
why he did so, Knowlton lowered his gun and
sank again into his chair.</p>

<p>“Do you want Knowlton?” shouted Loring,
pointing to the deputy beside him. As he spoke,
he glanced at his watch, which lay in his hand.
His face was reeking with sweat.</p>

<p>“Do you want Knowlton?” he shouted
again.</p>

<p>The howl that went up from the mob was as
if from the throats of blood-hungry beasts.</p>

<p>Knowlton’s face was white; but his eyes
showed their scorn of Loring. He looked at
him in contempt, and looking, to his surprise,
saw the tense lines of his face light with the gleam
of victory.</p>

<p>“You want Knowlton?” he shouted for the
last time. “Then come and take him!”</p>

<p>As the mob surged up the steps, a body of
horsemen charged them fiercely from behind.
Right and left galloped the riders, beating the
mob over the heads with their Winchesters,
or cutting them with their quirts, riding down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
men beneath the weight of their horses. The
mob scattered and fled in every direction. The
leader of the horsemen swung out of the saddle
in front of the steps, and Winchester in hand,
walked up to Loring.</p>

<p>“Are you Mr. Loring?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Stephen.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems as if we were just in time—not
much too early, are we? We just got your
telegram in Dominion in time to raise a big
posse, and pack them onto the evening train.
It was about the liveliest job that I ever did,
and I reckon it is one of the best,” said the
sheriff, surveying the scene with satisfaction.
“How did the trouble start anyhow?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Stephen explained rapidly. At the conclusion,
the sheriff turned to Knowlton: “Killed him
by accident, eh? Too bad you didn’t have
the pleasure of meaning to. Now I guess we’d
better clean up the camp a bit, hadn’t we, Mr.
Loring?”</p>

<p>Stephen agreed, and the sheriff sent his
deputies in groups of twos and threes, to raid
the tents of the Mexicans, and gather in their
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowlton approached Loring in a stupefied
manner.</p>

<p>“When could you have telegraphed?” he
asked. “They have been guarding the roads
ever since the shooting.”</p>

<p>Stephen smiled. “When you jumped into
that crowd, Knowlton, I sent Reade out through
the back window of the office to send a telegram
for help, and to get horses for them ready
at the station camp.”</p>

<p>A light broke over McKay’s face. Walking
up to Loring, he laid his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“By God, Steve, I am proud of you!” he
said. Then turning to the arc light which hung
from the ceiling of the porch, he addressed it
softly: “And <em>that’s</em> the man we fired!”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>In the middle of the following September,
Radlett arrived in Tucson from the East.
He was on his way to pay his first visit to
his property in Kay, since Stephen had taken
charge. As he signed his name on the hotel
register, his eye was caught by the names of the
arrivals of the day before.</p>

<p>“Donald Cameron.”</p>

<p>“Miss Cameron.”</p>

<p>A flush came to his cheeks and a light to his
eyes as he looked steadily at the page. Strange
what power a written word may have to stir
a man to the depths of his being! As Radlett
read the names, he felt the years slip away from
him. Five, six years was it since that summer
at Bar Harbor when he and Jean Cameron had
climbed together about the cliffs of the spouting
horn or, staff in hand, had explored Duck
Brook or floated idly in his canoe around the
islands in the harbor? Like Loring he had
dreamed his dream of what might be. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
end of the summer he knew it was only a dream
of what might have been. He carried away
with him an ideal, an aching heart, and a knot
of ribbon of the Cameron plaid. But he was
a man of too much force and energy to spend
his life in bewailing the past. He had shut the
knot of ribbon in a secret drawer, set the ideal
in a shrine, and flung his heart into business
with such success that to-day, while he was still
a young man, he was already a power to be
reckoned with in the financial world, while a
golden career opened ahead of him.</p>

<p>A man so loyal in his friendship could not be
other than loyal in his love; but he had put the
possibility of winning Jean Cameron definitely
out of his mind, and he would have sworn that
the years had reduced the fever of his feeling
to a genial tranquillity of friendship, when now
at the very sight of her name on a hotel register,
all his philosophy was put to flight and he was
conscious only of a burning desire to see her
once more.</p>

<p>Being a man of action, he wasted no time
on reminiscence; but inquired in quick incisive
terms whether Mr. Cameron and his daughter
were still at the hotel. Learning that they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
he sent up his card. Then he lighted a cigarette
and walked the floor of the lobby, smoking nervously
till the bell-boy returned to say that
Mr. Cameron would be glad to receive him in
his private sitting-room. Before following the
boy, Radlett stopped at the desk to arrange for
his room and get his key.</p>

<p>“How good a room do you wish, sir, and
how long will you stay?”</p>

<p>“The best you have, and as long as I choose,”
Radlett answered with characteristic brevity.
A moment later he stood before the door of the
Camerons’ sitting-room, which opened at his
knock to reveal Mr. Cameron’s bristling red
head in the foreground, and in the background
a figure in a traveling dress of gray cloth, with
a hat to match and a knot of plaided ribbon
under the brim.</p>

<p>At sight of Radlett, Jean rose, smiling, but
with a slight consciousness in her manner, a
consciousness resulting from the remembrance
of a painful scene, the hope that the man before
her had quite forgiven and the slighter
hope, a mere faint ashamed shadow of a hope,
that he had not quite forgotten.</p>

<p>Her mind must have been quickly set at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
rest on that point, for such a rush of feeling
swept over Radlett that he could scarcely make
his greetings intelligible. Mr. Cameron gave
him a firm grip, and Jean held out a gray gloved
hand which Radlett clasped tremulously. Mr.
Cameron looked at the man and girl as they
stood talking together, and the longer he looked
the better he liked the combination.</p>

<p>“There would be a son-in-law to be proud
of,” he thought, naturally enough perhaps considering
him in that relation first. “Baird Radlett
has everything that a girl could ask,—a
hard head, a long purse, a free hand and an
endless stock of common sense. And then, if
I had him to help me, what a property I could
build up! He used to seem devoted to Jean.
But she could not have refused him—no, and
by heaven she should not.” (Mr. Cameron
liked to keep up even to himself the illusion that
he was a tyrannical parent whose will was law.)
“Rather different this man from Loring! Jean
must see that. If she does not, she must be
made to see it. I was afraid at one time that
she might be foolish enough to fall in love with
Loring; but I took it in time—I took it in
time. Yet she is too efficient not to make some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
one big mistake in her life. We Camerons all
do it sooner or later. If it is not one thing it is
another—misdirected energy, I suppose—”
Then aloud, in answer to a question from Radlett
as to how he happened to be in that part of
the world: “Why, about a year and a half ago
I became interested in a mine in Arizona which
was not being run properly, and so for the
present I am giving up my time to managing it
myself.”</p>

<p>“And have you too become a mining engineer?”
Radlett asked of Jean.</p>

<p>“Not quite,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Jean came rather near it at first,” added
her father; “but I think that now she is half
tired of the life out here. It has not the charm
for her that it had at first.”</p>

<p>“I should think not!” exclaimed Radlett
emphatically. “Do you mean that you have
spent a whole year out in the hills here?” he
asked Jean.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “This trip marks the
first time that I have been back to the East
since last fall; but I have not yet become such
a savage that I can dispense with afternoon
tea. I hope you will join us,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, with thanks,” Radlett answered. Up
to this moment he had never found any use for
Tucson. Now he discovered that it existed to
hold a tea-table and Jean Cameron.</p>

<p>“What brings you to Tucson, Baird?” she
asked, while the waiter laid the cloth.</p>

<p>“I am in the mining business myself, in a
small way,” he rejoined. “Last year I bought
a property in Pinal County on speculation. I
am going up to visit it now for the first time.
I do not really need to go. In fact I shall probably
do more harm than good. I have a manager
up there who has accomplished wonders. He
has made the mine pay in six months after he
took control. As far as I can learn, he has done
practically everything himself, from mining the
ore to putting it on the cars. I bought the mine
at a big risk, and now it is about the most satisfactory
investment that I own.”</p>

<p>“I wish that I had such a man to put in
charge of Quentin. When I am not there the
whole plant seems to go to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Quentin!” exclaimed Radlett in surprise.
“Is that the name of your property?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Mr. Cameron. “Why? Had
you ever heard of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Radlett opened his lips to speak; but the
arrival of the tea turned the subject of conversation
for the moment. As he watched Jean pouring
the tea all thoughts of mines and business
vanished from Radlett’s mind. He wondered
how he had ever existed throughout the years
in which he had not seen her.</p>

<p>While Jean Cameron talked to Radlett, she
glanced at him over her teacup with that interest
which a girl naturally bestows upon a
man who might have been a part of her life
had she so willed it. In the past year the standards
by which she judged men had changed
considerably. She had much more regard for
the qualities of steadiness and determination
which Baird possessed than she had felt at the
time when she refused him. From her widened
experiences she had learned that ability without
reliability was useless. Perhaps, too, now
that disappointment in her new surroundings
had set in, she looked back with more tenderness
upon those who had peopled her life in the
East.</p>

<p>The talk ranged over many scenes and people
familiar to them all, then gradually drifted
to the plans of each for the future. Baird’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mind had been working fast. Seeing Jean for
an hour had made him wish to see her for many
more hours, and by the time that he had finished
his second cup of tea, he had evolved a plan by
which he hoped to achieve that end. If he
could persuade Mr. Cameron, when on his way
to Quentin, to stop over at Kay, and to make
an expert report on the property, it would
enable him to have at least a week more with
Jean. Turning to Mr. Cameron, he approached
him on the subject.</p>

<p>“I wish very much that I could persuade you
to stop over and examine my property for me.
If you had the time I should greatly value your
professional opinion.”</p>

<p>“Where is your mine situated?”</p>

<p>“At Kay,” answered Radlett. “I think it is
on the direct route to Quentin.”</p>

<p>“So you are the man who bought that property.
I had not heard who owned it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Baird. “Now do you think that
you could possibly spare four or fives days to
investigate the place for me?”</p>

<p>“I do not know whether I can possibly spare
the time,” reflected Mr. Cameron, half aloud.
If it had been any man besides Radlett, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Cameron would have refused at once, as he
had for some time given up all such work. But
he was glad to do a favor to Baird, and also he
felt that he would like to have him and Jean
thrown together for a while. “Still I can get
in touch with Quentin, and if they need me
there I can get there at short notice. Yes, I
think that I can take the time. I shall be interested
to see how the mine is doing with this
wonderful new manager of yours. Frankly, it
never used to be much good.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraging, Father!” said Jean.
“You might at least be an optimist until you
have seen Baird’s mine.”</p>

<p>“If your father should be a pessimist after
seeing it, I should certainly give up the mine,
I have such respect for his judgment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron expanded under the compliment.
“By the way, did you not have a big
riot or something up there this spring? I read
about it, I think, in the Eastern papers. They
said that there had been a race riot in Kay
which, but for the coolness and nerve of the manager,
would have been a desperate outbreak.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a desperate state of affairs,”
answered Radlett, and he proceeded to give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
account of the riot, the details of which he had
learned through a postscript added by Reade
to one of Loring’s reports. When he reached
the part of the story which told how the manager
had held the mob at bay until the arrival of the
deputies, both Jean and her father exclaimed
with approval. Jean’s eyes were shining with
the enthusiasm which she always felt for a
brave act well carried out.</p>

<p>“And,” said Radlett in conclusion, “since
then there has not been a hint of trouble in the
camp. In fact a labor agitator came up there
last month, and the men themselves ran him
out of camp.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have a wonderful man there,”
said Mr. Cameron. “If I had chanced upon
him first, you would never have had him. If
there is one thing on which I pride myself, it is
my power to read character at first sight. I
should have snapped up a man like that in no
time. What is his name?”</p>

<p>“His name,” said Radlett, “is Stephen Loring.”
He watched Mr. Cameron closely as he
uttered the name, and was amused to see the
expression of blank dismay and astonishment
upon that gentleman’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Loring! Stephen Loring!” cried Mr.
Cameron, completely taken aback.</p>

<p>“Stephen Loring,” repeated Radlett doggedly.</p>

<p>“Why, we dismissed him from Quentin
for—”</p>

<p>“Father, don’t!” ejaculated Jean suddenly.
Her cheeks burned, while her eyes pleaded
with her father to spare Loring’s past. Radlett
looked at her with a quick glance of
appreciation.</p>

<p>“It is all right, Jean,” he said. “Loring told
me all about it himself.”</p>

<p>“He told you,” queried Mr. Cameron incredulously,
“about the accident, about his
drunkenness and all; and after that you put
him in charge of the mine? How could you?”</p>

<p>“I believed in him,” replied Radlett quietly,
“and he has justified my belief. I have known
him all my life, and I trust and respect him.”</p>

<p>“You say that he has made good with you?”
inquired Mr. Cameron sharply.</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron was a man of honest enthusiasms,
but of equally honest hatreds. When
man had once failed him, he was loath to
believe that there could be good in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope you will find that he keeps it up,”
was all that he said. He did not say it with
complimentary conviction, either.</p>

<p>“He will,” Radlett answered shortly.</p>

<p>Jean was moved by Baird’s faithful defense
of his friend.</p>

<p>“It is characteristic of you to stand by him as
you have done,” she said, “and if ever a man
needed a good friend, it was Mr. Loring.”</p>

<p>“You knew him well?” asked Radlett, with
surprise. From what Loring had told him of
his position in camp, he had not imagined that
he would know Miss Cameron personally at all.</p>

<p>“He saved my life,” answered Jean. Her
voice was soft, but there was a hint of challenge
in the glance that she sent toward her father.</p>

<p>“Saved your life!” ejaculated Radlett. “He
never said anything to me about that. Just
like him! He told me only of his failures.”</p>

<p>“You have known him all your life. What
was he?” asked Mr. Cameron. “Another case
of a worthless fellow whom every one liked?”</p>

<p>“He never was worthless,” said Baird. “Only
until now he never showed what he was worth,
and never was there a man whom his friends
loved so much, to whom they forgave so much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and from whom they continued to hope so
much.”</p>

<p>“He took a peculiar way of showing his
worth with me,” remarked Mr. Cameron.
“Really now, Radlett, killing men by your
carelessness is a pretty serious thing. And
from what I can gather, I judge that for the
past few years his life has been far from creditable;
that he has been getting into trouble of
some sort all the time. His record shows that
he has been permanently inefficient and frequently
drunk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is all true,” answered Baird, “but
in all those years he was being hammered and
forged, and in the end the experience has
strengthened him. The things that he has gone
through, even the wrong things which he has
done, all have molded his character, and for
the better. It was a big risk, a big chance,
but by it the metal in him has been turned to
steel.”</p>

<p>“Is not that rather an expensive process by
which to obtain a product like Loring?” asked
Mr. Cameron dryly.</p>

<p>“I hope very much that when you see what
Loring has done at Kay, you will change your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
mind,” said Radlett. “I understand of course
what you must feel about him; but I think
that he has wiped his slate clean. If two lives
were lost through him at Quentin, by preventing
a fight at Kay he has saved twenty.”</p>

<p>“Not to mention saving my life,” added Jean,
rising.</p>

<p>“That alone should extenuate everything,”
said Radlett earnestly.</p>

<p>He looked after Jean as she left the room to
dress for dinner, admiring her proud, erect
carriage, and devoutly thankful that he should
have several days in which to be with her.</p>

<p>When she had gone, the two men resumed
their seats, and proceeded to discuss the plans
and business arrangements for Mr. Cameron’s
prospective visit to Kay. But even while he
was talking, Mr. Cameron’s decision in regard
to the visit was wavering, and later, as he went
upstairs, he shook his head and said to himself:
“No, I can’t do it. Under the circumstances
that visit is an impossibility.”</p>

<p>That night, when they had come upstairs
from dinner, he went to Jean’s door and
knocked.</p>

<p>“Jean,” he called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Father.”</p>

<p>“Can you come into my sitting-room? I
want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>They returned to his sitting-room, and Jean
seated herself while her father walked slowly
up and down the room.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about our going with
Baird up to his mine. I told him that we would
go; but if this fellow Loring is the manager
there, I do not think that we can. I shall tell
Baird that we find it impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jean, although she well knew
the reason.</p>

<p>“Why?” echoed her father irritably. “Do
you remember the insulting letter which he
wrote to me after my offer of help to him at
Dominion? Do you think it would be a pleasure
to meet him again with that letter in mind?”</p>

<p>“You never told me what you wrote in your
letter to him,” replied Jean, parrying the
question.</p>

<p>“I offered him work in the north because
I said we were under obligation to him for saving—That
is, to repay my debt to him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that you made no conditions?”</p>

<p>“Only that he should never cross our path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
again,” responded her father. “Of course I
felt bound to tell him what I thought of him.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” exclaimed Jean with
spirit, “you insulted him, and now are angry
that he was gentleman enough to refuse your
offer. When he was practically starving, as
Baird told me he was, he refused to take advantage
of an unwilling obligation. Is that
why you do not want to go to Kay?” There
was pride in the quiver of her nostrils, and pity
in her eyes, as she spoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron, like many strong men, was at
a disadvantage in an argument with his daughter.
Her strength of will was as great as his, and
with it she combined an intuitive knowledge of
whither to direct her questions, as a good fencer
instinctively knows the weak points in his opponent’s
defense.</p>

<p>“You are trying to put me in the wrong,
Jean,” said her father testily, “but the fact remains
that we cannot go.”</p>

<p>“The fact remains, Father, that you owe it
to yourself to go, not only because you have
promised Baird” (here she scored a strong point,
for the keeping of his word was her father’s
great pride), “but because you owe it to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Loring to atone for the wrong that you did
him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron was in a quandary. On the
one side was his desire not to see Loring again
or to have Jean meet him; on the other was
the fact that he had promised Radlett and that
he wished to have him and Jean thrown together.
With his usual bluntness he asked his
daughter: “Jean, have you thought much of
Loring since he left Quentin?”</p>

<p>“A great deal, Father.”</p>

<p>“Often?”</p>

<p>“Very often.”</p>

<p>“Damn me! I was afraid of it. But you
may as well understand now that I absolutely
forbid your thinking of him any more.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Father, that you do not add to
my real interest the fictitious one of defiance
which has always been strong in the Cameron
blood. What I have been thinking all these
months about Mr. Loring is that he is a man
to whom we are under deep obligation, and
one to whom you have been unjust.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Mr. Cameron helplessly,
and foolishly allowing his attack to be changed
to defense, “that I had done everything possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
for Loring. I do not wish to be thought ungrateful
to any man; but that letter—”</p>

<p>Jean was touched and coming over to her
father, put her arms around him saying: “Can’t
you see, Father dear, that the letter he sent to
you was the only one which a gentleman could
write under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, perhaps,” answered Mr. Cameron.
“And anyhow,” he went on rather
weakly, “I have promised Baird, and Jean, I
want you to see more of him. He is, I think, of
all the men whom I know, the best and the
most trustworthy. He told me that some time
ago you refused to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jean.</p>

<p>“Have you ever changed at all? Do you not
like him better than you did? He is the man
of all others whom I should rather see you
marry.”</p>

<p>“I always liked him and I like him better
than ever now,” replied Jean, with her usual
frankness. “Only it would take me at least a
week to fall in love with him,” she added
laughing, as she kissed her father and bade
him good night.</p>

<p>That evening she sat up until it was late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
thinking. She had begun to see life in the West
rather differently since her first rose-colored
impressions. She was beginning to realize the
facts that her father had quoted to her. The
shoddiness of that life had begun to make itself
felt. She had believed in Loring with all the
trust to which a reserved nature yields itself
when it becomes impetuous, and his complete
failure had been a deep shock to her. She had
not forgotten him, however, though, had she
analyzed her thoughts, she would have been
puzzled to know why he had not passed from
her memory. Now that he was to be brought
into her life again, her thought of him grew
deeper and more personal. She opened her
trunk and drew out of it her journal of the past
year. For an hour she sat reading over the pages,
and there were certain pages which she reread.
When she closed the book it was close to midnight.
She sat staring out of the window,
thinking, wondering. The light in her eyes
was like the harbor lights veiled by night mist
to the mariner homeward bound,—now flashing
clear and lambent, now dim, brilliant with
the seaward flash or soft in the afterglow.</p>

<p>At length she rose as one tired of thinking;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
but as she brushed out the long waves of her
hair she hummed softly the old refrain:</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>In the weeks which followed the settling
of the trouble in the camp, Kay flourished
and grew. Great trainloads of supplies
were daily dumped on the platform of the
railway station, to be checked off and sorted,
before the final haul up to camp. The old
rough road to the station had become hard
and smooth by the continual pounding of
the heavy, six-mule wagons. Under McKay’s
master direction, the framework bridges on
the route had been replaced by substantial
structures. Wherever a cañon or gulch opened,
sluice boxes had been buried beneath the road
surface, so that a heavy rain no longer meant
washouts and consequent stoppage of coke
and supplies. The coke teams struggled back
to the railroad almost as heavily laden with
matt, as on the upward trip they had been with
coke. Each day saw new framework houses
built, and new families settling their possessions.
Wagons were driven into camp laden with
battered stoves, broken chairs, a stray dog or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
two, and in general the household belongings
of new settlers; for the growth of the “lilies of
the field” is as nothing compared with that
of a prosperous mining camp. Each day the
office was filled with men clamoring for
lumber: “Only a little, Boss! Just to put in
a flooring. We can get along with two boards
on the sides. Anything just so as we can get
settled.” And Loring sat behind his desk,
speaking with kindly but evasive words, telling
each that the Company longed to build him a
perfect palace, but that under the present conditions
he must wait.</p>

<p>For fast as lumber was hauled into camp,
still faster came the need for it for mine timbering,
for storehouses, and for a thousand and one
necessities. The construction work had been
rushed to completion. The huge new ore cribs
were a triumph of McKay’s ingenuity, built by
a clever system of bracing from the unseasoned
lumber that had been at hand, and supporting
with perfect safety the enormous strain to which
they were subjected. The Company was rapidly
becoming the controlling factor in the copper
output of the district.</p>

<p>It was the time for the arrival of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
mail and the office was full of men and tobacco
smoke. McKay had pre-empted the safe and
sat on the top of it, clanking his heels against
the sides. His sandy colored hair matched the
color of the pine boards of the wall against which
he was propped. The draughting tables carried
their load of men, as did each of the well-worn
chairs, and the three-legged stool. A babel
of voices prevailed. Every now and then Reade
opened the door from the back office, and poking
his head into the room with a disgusted
expression upon his face, called out: “Soft
pedal there, soft pedal! How in hell can a
man do any work with you fellows raising
such a racket?”</p>

<p>Stephen, as usual sat at his roll-top desk in
the corner, his feet up on the slide, both hands
in his pockets, the while he rocked his pipe
gently up and down in his teeth. One of the
clerks was telling with becoming modesty of
his social triumphs in Phœnix at the “Elks”
ball. The audience listened with the listless
attention of those whose curiosity hangs heavy
on their hands.</p>

<p>“I was the candy kid, all right,” remarked
the narrator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>His fervid discourse was interrupted by a
drawl from some one in the background. “I
reckon that some time you must have drunk
copiouslike of the Hassayampeh River.”</p>

<p>A machinery drummer who was in the office
cocked up his ears, thinking that perhaps behind
the allusion lay a doubtful story.</p>

<p>“What’s that about the river?” he asked.
“I never heard of that.”</p>

<p>“Why, they say,” answered the first speaker,
“that whoever drinks of the Hassayampeh
River can’t ever tell the truth again so long as
he lives.”</p>

<p>“And also,” added McKay; “that no matter
where he drifts to, he is sure to wander back
again to the old territory; that he’ll die in
Arizona.”</p>

<p>“How was that story ever started?” Loring
asked.</p>

<p>“The valley of the Hassayampeh was one of
the first trails into the ore country,” answered
McKay, “and the lies that emanated from the
camps along that river was of such a fearful,
godless and prize package variety that they made
the old river famous. There was a fellow in
camp here only the other day was telling me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
about prospectin’ down there in seventy-three.
He said all they had to eat was fried Gila
monster. I guess that was after he’d drunk the
water though,” finished McKay reflectively.</p>

<p>“The territory sure has gone off since those
days,” said a cattleman who had ridden into
camp for his mail. “Only last year down near
Roosevelt I shot two Mexicans, and say, it
cost me a hundred dollars for negligence,” he
went on indignantly, “and the sons of guns
warn’t wurth more than twelve dollars and two
bits apiece.”</p>

<p>“You are right about the way Arizona is
going to hell,” said the mine foreman. “I don’t
know as any of you fellows ever knowed ‘Teeth’
Barker. Anyhow, next to what his father must
have been, he was the ugliest creature that ever
lived on this earth. All of his teeth just naturally
stuck out like the cowcatcher of an engine.
Well, in spite of that, he always was a good
friend of mine. Least he used to be.</p>

<p>“About six months ago I was up to Jerome,
and they was telling about an accident there.
A man no one knowed at all was killed,
but a fellow said he had the ugliest tusks
he ever seed. I knew at once that must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Barker. They said they’d planted him up on
the knoll, and so,” continued the foreman sadly,
“and so, although it was a powerful hot day,
I struggled up to the knoll with a nice piece of
pine board, and a jack-knife, and I sort of
located ‘Teeth’ with a handsome monument
and an exaggerated epitaph.</p>

<p>“I came down as hot as the devil, and steps
into a saloon to get a drink, when who should
walk up to me but ‘Teeth’ Barker himself!</p>

<p>“‘You’re dead,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Do I look like it?’ he asked. He got sort
of hot under the collar about it, too.</p>

<p>“Well, the long and short of it all was that I
had gone and taken all that trouble with a
tombstone for a stranger.</p>

<p>“‘The least that you can do, “Teeth” Barker,’
said I, ‘is to come up and see that beautiful
monument I erected over you. It took as much
trouble to make as a year’s assessment work.’</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t see it that way. Said he
wouldn’t go up there if I was to pay him. And
that was after I had taken all that trouble!
Gratitude! There ain’t no such thing any
more in Arizona,” concluded the foreman.</p>

<p>Story after story was put forth for the edification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of the crowd until the grating of wheels
outside told of the arrival of the stage. A moment
later heavy footsteps resounded on the
porch, and the burly stage-driver, with two great
mail-sacks slung over his shoulder, swung into
the office.</p>

<p>“Evening, gents!” he called in answer to
the general salutation. He stepped over to
Stephen’s desk and threw down a little bunch of
envelopes. “Four telegrams,” he said.</p>

<p>Loring rapidly slit open the envelopes, laying
the telegrams on one side, and after running
through the contents, began to sort the mail.</p>

<p>“Any passengers?” he asked the driver.</p>

<p>“Yes, six. Drummers mostly. They are
over there eating now. There was two men
and a lady; but they stopped to eat supper at
the station. They will be up later.”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky Mrs. Brown built those new
sleeping quarters to her place; she’ll be running
a regular hotel here soon,” said the driver,
as he swung on his heel and tramped out to
unharness his horses.</p>

<p>Stephen sorted the mail rapidly, and deftly
scaled the letters to the fortunate recipients.</p>

<p>“That is all,” he said, as he tossed the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Every one left the office with the exception of
McKay who, with a woebegone expression on
his face, lingered behind.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Loring.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered McKay gruffly.</p>

<p>“Well, how is this?” said Stephen, taking
from his pocket a letter which was addressed in
large square characters to McKay. “You see
she did not forget you, after all.”</p>

<p>McKay blushed to the roots of his hair, then
opened the letter with seeming nonchalance.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you have a pretty
steady correspondent there,” said Stephen,
while he straightened up his desk preparatory
to the evening’s work. “I have handed you
a letter like that every night this week.” McKay
colored even more, then stretched out his hand.
“Shake, Steve! I am going to get spliced. I
have been meaning to tell you before this.”</p>

<p>Loring jumped up and pounded him on the
back.</p>

<p>“You gay winner of hearts, who is she?”</p>

<p>“Do you remember Jane Stevens, back at
Quentin? Well, it’s her.”</p>

<p>Loring’s eyes twinkled. “How did you ever
get the nerve?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>At the thought of his audacity, the perspiration
broke out on McKay’s forehead.</p>

<p>“Well she had me plumb locoed. I remember
once a horse had me buffaloed the same way,”
he explained. “I was scared, scared blue,
Steve; but finally I got up my nerve and
thought I’d go and break my affections to her
gentle and polite like. So one day I rode over
to their place,—you know where it is was, just
south of the Dominion trail,—and I thought
I’d go to see her brother Charlie and fix
it up with him. When I reached their
shack she came to the door looking as neat
as a partridge and with a sort of smile hidden
somewhere in her face, and—and I’ll be
damned if I didn’t kiss her right then without
any formalities.”</p>

<p>“That was the simplest solution of the problem,
wasn’t it?” laughed Stephen. “When are
you going to be married?”</p>

<p>“Oh, soon, I guess; but I wish it could be
managed as simply as these Mexicans do. And
how about you, Steve?” continued McKay.
“You ain’t been took this way yourself, have
you? Not that woman you was telling me
about in Mexico.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Loring shook his head. “Unfortunately she
was a married woman.”</p>

<p>“I sort of thought,” went on McKay, “that
you and Miss Cameron was—”</p>

<p>“Well, you thought wrongly,” interrupted
Loring sharply. “I never expect to see Miss
Cameron again.”</p>

<p>There came a ripple of laughter from the doorway,
and looking up quickly he saw Jean and
her father walk into the office. Behind them
stood Baird Radlett.</p>

<p>“What a hospitable form of welcome!” exclaimed
Miss Cameron, smiling at him frankly.</p>

<p>For a moment Loring swayed in his chair,
then he rose stiffly, as a man in a trance. He
stared at Jean with an absorption that was
almost rude, as if there were nothing in the
universe beyond her. There lay a hint of
laughter in the gray depths of her eyes.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Radlett.
“Are you surprised to see us? Didn’t you get
my letter?”</p>

<p>“It is probably in to-night’s mail which
haven’t opened yet,” answered Loring, still
half dazed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cameron has consented to come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
make a report on the property for me,” explained
Baird.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron came forward and held out
his hand. “Mr. Loring, I have heard of the
splendid work that you have done here. I want
to congratulate you.” This little speech was
a hard one for Mr. Cameron to make; but he
was a man who, when he had once made up
his mind to the right course, followed it to the
end.</p>

<p>The expression of pride in Stephen’s face
turned to one of appreciation, and he shook
Mr. Cameron’s hand with a firm, grateful
pressure. But all the while he was looking
at Jean longingly, worshipingly, all unconscious
of the intensity of his gaze, as a man
who for days has been in the desert without
water looks upon the sudden spring. In all
the months that he had thought of her, dreamed
of her, she had never seemed to have the beauty,
the potential tenderness, which marked her
now when she stood before him, her look telling
him that she was proud of what her friend had
been and done.</p>

<p>To Radlett, looking at them both, came a
sudden suspicion, and a sudden despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean, at Loring’s request, seated herself at
his desk, in the big revolving chair, and while
playing absent-mindedly with the papers on
the desk, kept up a laughing discussion with
Baird.</p>

<p>Loring, at the other side of the room, was
answering Mr. Cameron’s businesslike questions
as to the grade of the ore, the force, the
cost of production, accurately and fast, as
though almost every faculty in his body and
mind were not concentrated upon the girl who
seemed to be having such an interesting talk
with Radlett. Finishing his talk with Mr.
Cameron, Loring left the office to arrange for
sleeping quarters for the visitors. In a few
minutes he returned with the announcement
that all was ready, and led the way to the long,
low building next the mess, whose many rooms,
opening on a broad porch, served as accommodations
for strangers in camp.</p>

<p>Loring walked beside Miss Cameron, doing
his best to talk unconcernedly of every-day
matters, but the hoarseness of his voice betrayed
him.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to have to offer you such
rough quarters,” he said to Jean, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
reached the house, “but they are the best that
we have. In another month we hope to have
something more comfortable to give to our
guests.”</p>

<p>“In another month, Stephen, you will have
an up-to-date city constructed here,” exclaimed
Radlett, with an almost reluctant enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At the steps Stephen and Radlett said good-night
to the others, and walked slowly back to
Stephen’s quarters, which they were to share.</p>

<p>Loring sat on the edge of his cot, and smoked
slowly while he watched Baird unpack his
valise, and with the method of an orderly
nature put everything away in the rough chest
of drawers, or on the black iron hooks which
protruded from the wall. Espying a tin of expensive
tobacco neatly packed amidst a circle
of collars, Stephen pounced upon it, and knocking
out the contents of his pipe, proceeded to
fill it with the new mixture. Radlett finished
his unpacking, and recovering the tobacco can
from Loring, filled his own pipe. Then he
tipped a chair back against the wall, and
sitting in it, regarded Loring for a moment
in silence.</p>

<p>“Stephen,” he remarked after a few seconds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
“you have done a good piece of work. I knew
that you would.”</p>

<p>Loring’s irrelevant answer was to the effect
that the tobacco which he had stolen was good.
It was an odd characteristic of this man that
though his nature contained many streaks of
vanity, praise for work which he knew was good
embarrassed him. At length he began to appreciate
the ungraciousness of his response to
Radlett’s advances, and leaning forward, with
his elbows on his knees, he said: “You cannot
guess what it means to me, Baird, to have you
say things like that, to be patted on the back
and made to feel as if I had done something,
and that by a man who has succeeded in everything
to which he has turned his hand, who has
won all the big prizes of life.”</p>

<p>Radlett drew back into the shadow where
the lamplight could not reveal the expression
of his face.</p>

<p>“All the prizes in life?” he queried with
scornful emphasis. “No, not all by a damn
sight. You see, Stephen, I feel as if Fate had
stood over me with a deuced ironical smile,
and said: ‘You shall have your every wish
in life—except the one thing that you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
most of all—the one thing that would make
you happy.’”</p>

<p>“Hm,” murmured Loring, shaking out the
embers from his pipe and gazing into the empty
bowl. “With any one else I should say that
meant a woman; but with you it could not
be.”</p>

<p>“Why not with me as well as with any other
man?”</p>

<p>“Because there is no woman alive who would
be fool enough to refuse you.”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, Stephen! It is only
your blind loyalty that makes you think me
irresistible.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that there really is a woman
so benighted? What is she thinking of?”</p>

<p>“I imagine,” answered Radlett slowly, “that
you might change that ‘what’ to <em>whom</em>.”</p>

<p>“You would have me believe that knowing
you, she prefers some one else?” asked Loring
incredulously. “Why, Baird, it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“By no means. I think I know the man.”</p>

<p>Loring’s blood boiled. “Who is the brute?”
he cried out. “Tell me and I will kill him,
break his neck, shoot him.”</p>

<p>Baird smiled wryly, blew a cloud of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
toward the roof, and observed: “If I were you,
Stephen, I would do nothing rash. But come,
we have talked long enough of me and my
affairs. Let us talk now about you and yours!
Suppose, for instance, you tell me why you
turned the color of a meerschaum pipe when
Miss Cameron appeared in the doorway
to-night.”</p>

<p>Loring started and looked quickly at Radlett.
“You noticed that, did you? Well, you have
quick eye and a gift for drawing conclusions,
but they may not always be right.”</p>

<p>“Not always, no; but this time they are,
aren’t they? Be honest, Stephen, are you or
are you not in love with Jean Cameron?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but that can not interest you
to know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, and perhaps it is a damned
impertinence to inquire, but after all an old
friendship gives some privileges.”</p>

<p>“Of course it does!” exclaimed Stephen,
tilting down his chair. He walked across the
room to Radlett’s seat and stood behind him.
“See here, Baird. I did not want to speak of
this thing because I was afraid of breaking
down and making an ass of myself generally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
You don’t know what it is to be placed as I am.
When you asked a girl to marry you, you had
something to offer her, whether she had the
sense to take it or not. You offered her a clean
life, a fortune honorably made, an untarnished
name, while I,—why even if there were the
remotest chance that Miss Cameron would
look at me, I should be a brute to ask her. The
more I cared for her, the less I could do it. So
you see, for me it must be ‘the desire of the
moth for the star.’ A man must abide by the
consequences of his acts; he must take his
medicine, and if mine is bitter, it may do me
all the more good only—only I cannot talk
about it. Good night!”</p>

<p>Radlett did not answer; but long after
Stephen was asleep, or pretended to be, Baird
lay staring at the rafters. “To lay down his
life for his friend,” he said to himself. “That
would not be the hardest thing. To lay down
his love! I wonder if I am man enough to
do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>During the week which the Camerons
spent in camp at Kay, it was amusing
to notice the change in the appearance
of the men at the mess. Dilapidated flannel
shirts and khaki trousers the worse for wear
had been supplanted at supper time by self-conscious
black suits and very white ties. The
camp barber made enough money to tide him
over many months.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron had spent a very busy week,
examining with Loring all the details of the
work, and daily his respect had grown for the
man whom he had so despised. The evening
before the last which she was to spend in Kay,
Jean announced her intention of visiting the
“workings” with her father when he should go
the next day. Loring said that it was not safe;
her father protested; Radlett argued with her, and
as the net result of all she appeared the following
morning with her determination unchanged.</p>

<p>The porch of the mess a few minutes before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
breakfast time was always crowded. Men on
their way back from the night shift made a
practise of stopping to exchange a few words.
It was a quieter gathering than in the evening,
for ahead lay the prospect of a long day’s work.
Yet an air of comfort always prevailed. The
five minutes before breakfast made a precious
interval in which to loaf, a delightful time when
one could stretch himself against the wall and
bask in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Jean and her father came up to the veranda
with a friendly “good morning” to those who
were gathered there. A few of the loiterers
talked respectfully to Mr. Cameron, whose
fame as a mining expert was a wide one, and
Jean quickly became the center of a large
group of men, eager to point out to her the different
mountains, the Grahams in the distance or
the long sharp ridges of the neighboring range.
They called her attention to the mist hanging
low in the valley, curling softly in the farthest
recesses. The mine foreman, usually the most
shiftlessly dressed man in camp, twitched his
polka-dotted tie into place when he thought
that Miss Cameron’s attention was absorbed
by the landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen came across from his quarters among
the last. He waited a moment before joining
the group about Miss Cameron; and his eyes
employed that moment in fixing a picture
indelibly on his mind. As Jean leaned lightly
against the wall, in her dress of white linen crash,
she made a picture which no one who saw could
forget. Her gray eyes were clear with the reflection
of the morning light, and the sun
searched for and illuminated the subtle tints of
her hair. She had a pretty way of speaking as
though everything she said were a simple answer
to a clever question. Men liked that.
They thought her appreciative.</p>

<p>She looked up to notice Loring’s glance upon
her, and answered his “good morning” lightly.
“You need not speak as though you were surprised,
Mr. Loring,” she said, “I may have
been late to breakfast five out of my six days, but
that is no sign that it is a habit with me. Besides,
you know that to-day I am to visit the mine.”</p>

<p>“So you are still determined?” he asked.
“Really, Miss Cameron, it is not very safe.
There might be an accident of some sort, and,”
he went on, looking at her gown, “you will ruin
your dress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you fancy that I travel with only one?”
Jean queried smiling. “It may be so, but not
even my vanity shall deter me; I really must
go.”</p>

<p>Just then Wah appeared on the veranda,
and began to pound with his railroad spike on
the iron triangle which, as at Quentin, served
for a dinner gong.</p>

<p>“La, la, boom, boom! Breakfast!” he
shouted, amidst the din which he was creating.
“Me bludder, Steve, he almost late. La, la,
boom, boom! Hot cakes, hot cakes; oh, lubbly
hot cakes, oh, lubbly, lubbly—!”</p>

<p>In the midst of his song he caught sight of
Jean, and stopping his pounding he beamed
upon her.</p>

<p>“Goodee morning, missee, goodee morning!
Missee on time this morning; how it happen?”</p>

<p>McKay angrily told him to shut up, but Miss
Cameron stopped the rebuke, assuring Wah
that his reproaches had been well deserved.</p>

<p>Several minutes after the others had begun
their meal, Radlett appeared at breakfast, still
struggling against sleepiness. Not even the
clear early morning air had thoroughly aroused
him. Breakfasts at half-past six were a distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and not wholly appreciated novelty to Baird.
He slipped into his place beside Jean, and endeavored
to parry her banter upon his indolence.
Stephen, at his side of the table, was occupied in
dispensing the platter of “flap jacks,” which
Wah, beaming with appreciation of their excellence,
had set before him to serve.</p>

<p>“At what time do we visit the mine?” asked
Jean across the table.</p>

<p>“As soon after breakfast as you and your
father are ready,” answered Stephen. “The
air is much better early in the day, before they
have begun to shoot down there. But I wish
that you would change your mind about going.”</p>

<p>Jean turned to the mine foreman for
assistance.</p>

<p>“It is perfectly safe, isn’t it, Mr. Burns?
I know that all my father and Mr. Loring think
is that I shall be in the way.”</p>

<p>Burns laboriously protested against such an
idea, and clumsily promised to look after her
safety.</p>

<p>In the minutes that preceded the seven o’clock
whistle, one by one the men straggled off to
their work, nodding respectfully to Jean and
her father as they left, and calling out parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
gibes at Wah. By the time that the whistle
blew, the line of ponies picketed to the fence
before the mess had disappeared, and the community
was at work.</p>

<p>As soon after breakfast as Mr. Cameron had
smoked his morning cigar, he joined Radlett
and Loring, and with Miss Cameron all walked
up to the mouth of the nearest shaft. Burns
met them at the shaft house, and selected from
the pile of oilskins a “slicker” for Miss Cameron.
She struggled helplessly with the stiff button-holes,
and Loring was obliged to button the
coat for her. His fingers, though stronger than
hers, were not much more efficient, owing to
their trembling.</p>

<p>“Where are the candles, Burns?” asked
Loring.</p>

<p>Burns pointed to a box in one corner of the
shaft house. Stephen took out a half dozen,
and handed one to each of the visitors. He
put a broken one into the spike candle holder
which he carried, and slipped the others into
his capacious pockets.</p>

<p>The “skip” shot up and was unloaded.
“All ready!” called Burns, steadying the bucket
by the level of the shaft mouth. Jean stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
forward and looked at the bucket just a bit
askance. Loring showed her how to place her
hands on the heavy iron links above the swivel,
and how to stand on the edge of the bucket with
her heels over the edge.</p>

<p>“Look out that your skirt does not hit against
the side of the shaft!” was his final injunction.</p>

<p>“Can we go down now?” he asked Burns.</p>

<p>“One second,” answered the foreman.
“There is a load of sharpened drills to go
down with us.”</p>

<p>In a moment the little “nipper” appeared
with his armful of drills, and with a ringing
clatter dropped them into the bottom of the
bucket.</p>

<p>“I think we had better take Mr. Cameron
to the four hundred level right away,” said
Stephen to Burns. “I want him to see that
new stope. The air isn’t very bad there, is
it?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s pretty fair.”</p>

<p>“All right. Lower away, four hundred!”
called Loring to the hoist engineer, at the same
time swinging himself onto the bucket beside
the others.</p>

<p>The skip began to drop slowly down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
timbered shaft. For the first twenty-five or
thirty feet it was fairly light, and Jean could
see the joints in the rough-grained, greasy
boards. Then all became dark. She clutched
the cable tightly and half closed her eyes. The
water began to drip down hard from above,
spattering sharply on their oilskins. Loring,
close beside her, whispered: “All right. Just
hold on tightly, Miss Cameron! Great elevator,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Even while Loring spoke, a chill struck to
his heart. What if the hoist engineer failed in
his duty! What if the bucket crashed into the
black depths that lay below them, or shot
wildly upward to be caught in the timbers at
the top! What if Jean Cameron were to be
snatched away as <em>those others</em> had been, through
the wanton carelessness of the man in charge
above! Would any punishment be black
enough for him? Would eternity be long
enough for him to make a decent repentance?</p>

<p>By the vigor of the answer which his heart
made to the question, Loring sensed the pang
of remorse which had gnawed at his conscience
without ceasing ever since that awful night.
“That was what you did.” The words said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
themselves over and over in his ear as the bucket
slid downward.</p>

<p>The air began to turn from the pure clear
atmosphere of the mountains to the heavy
close humidity of the mine, murky even in its
blackness.</p>

<p>“One hundred level,” explained Stephen,
as the bucket dropped past a candle which
flickered dully in a smoky hole in the side of
the shaft, the entrance to the drift which was
even blacker than the shaft itself.</p>

<p>As they reached the lower levels, the water
poured down faster. The bucket swung and
twisted and Jean leaned an imperceptible trifle
closer to Loring. He steadied her with his
arm, although it may not have been strictly
necessary for safety.</p>

<p>The bucket suddenly stopped and hung
lifelessly steady.</p>

<p>“Here we are, four hundred foot level,”
called Loring. “Please stay just where you are,
Miss Cameron, and we will help you off.” He
swung himself onto the landing stage after the
others, and taking both of Jean’s hands in his,
guided her safely into the drift.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment completely confused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
unable to make out anything. Loring
leaned out into the shaft, and pulling the bell
cord, signaled to have the bucket raised again.
Then he took Jean’s candle, and biting off the
wax from about the wick, lighted it and his
own, holding them under a small protecting
ledge of rock. To Jean’s unaccustomed eyes
the little flickerings made small difference in the
darkness. She stepped into a pool of water
that lay in the middle of the drift, wetting her
boots to the ankles.</p>

<p>“Careful!” said Loring, taking her by the
arm. “Keep your eyes on Burns’s candle ahead
there. I will see that you don’t fall.”</p>

<p>For a couple of hundred yards they walked
on straight ahead down the drift. Jean’s eyes
began to grow accustomed to the gray blackness,
and now, when the roof of the tunnel grew
suddenly lower, she stooped almost by instinct.</p>

<p>“Look out for the winze, Miss!” called
back Burns.</p>

<p>“All right!” answered Loring. “This runs
to the next level, a hundred feet down,” he
explained, as he helped Jean to cross the plank
which bridged a black chasm. She noticed the
rails of a little track which ran beneath their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
feet, and almost as she was on the point of asking
its purpose, from far ahead in the darkness
came a shrill, weird whistle, and a heavy
rumble.</p>

<p>Loring caught her and held her back against
the side wall as a “mucker” ran past, wheeling
a heavy ore car towards the shaft and
whistling as warning to clear the track. She
began to feel the effects of the powder fumes
in the air, and it made her head heavy and
drowsy. She felt that she had come into a
new, supernatural universe, where all was noisy,
dark, and strange.</p>

<p>At last the drift broadened out into a large,
irregular-shaped chamber.</p>

<p>“Esperanza stope,” said Loring to Miss
Cameron. “Here is where they have struck
the contact vein, where the porphyry changes
to limestone.” He held his candle close to the
dark wall of rock, and she could see the green
crusting betokening the copper.</p>

<p>“This will assay pretty close to ten per cent,
won’t it, Burns?” asked Loring.</p>

<p>“It ran to twelve, yesterday,” answered the
foreman.</p>

<p>They stood still for a moment. All about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
them, as in the crypt of some vast cathedral,
were specks of light, showing through the dense
air, the candles of the miners. Now and then
in the blur there appeared a distorted shape,
as some one moved before a candle. Through
all, loud, insistent, steady, rang the clink-clang,
clink-clang, clink-clang of the drills and hammers,
as a dozen miners drove home the holes
into the breast of the stope, the tapping of the
cleaning rods, as they spooned out the mud, and
the rattle of shovels on rock, as the “muckers”
loaded the ore cars. Mixed with these sounds
was a sharp hissing, as the miners drew in their
breath, swaying back for the driving blow on
the heads of the drills. As she grew accustomed
to the dim light, Jean could make out the miners
who were nearest to her, as, in teams of two,
stripped to the waist, their bodies shiny with
sweat, they battered on the walls. Faintly the
lines of grim archways began to grow out of
the dark, where rough pillars had been left to
support the roofing. Far off, up a cross-cut,
she could see more candles swaying. Two men
near her were toiling at a windlass, raising the
water from a new winze. She leaned against
the wall, and something rattled tinnily. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
a pile of canteens, all warm with the heat of the
air.</p>

<p>Jean gasped with the very wonder of the
scene. To the others it was merely the commonplace
of their work.</p>

<p>Burns called out to Loring: “We are going
to take Mr. Cameron through to the new stope.
It is pretty hard climbing getting through to
there. I guess the lady had better wait here
with you, Mr. Loring.”</p>

<p>The voices of the rest of the party sounded
faint and far away. Jean watched the light of
their candles sway and dip, as they walked off
down a tunnel, then disappear as a supporting
pillar hid them from view.</p>

<p>Loring led her to one side of the stope, and
drove the spike of his candle stick into a niche
in the soft rock wall. He pointed to a pile of
loose ore.</p>

<p>“We can sit here until your father returns.
They are not working this end of the stope
now,” he said.</p>

<p>She nodded and seated herself with her back
against the wall. Silent, with her chin propped
firmly in her clenched hands, she strained her
eyes to look at the dim lights and shadows at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the other end of the stope, and watched the
shadows grow into things, as she stared. Far
beneath her, in the solid rock, she heard faint
indistinct taps. A trifle awed by the mystery
she turned to Loring.</p>

<p>“What is that sound?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Those are ‘Tommy knockers,’” he answered
gravely. “They are the ghosts of men
who were killed in an explosion here, tapping
steadily for help.”</p>

<p>“Really?” she asked, half laughing.</p>

<p>“It might be,” answered Loring, “but the
fact of it is that those are men drilling on the
next level. The sound now and then carries
clear through the rock.”</p>

<p>The candle in the niche behind her cast a
dim light over the soft curves of Jean’s cheeks,
rising delicately above the rough yellow oilskin
coat. Loring beside her, looked down at her
intently. Turning, she inadvertently brushed
against his sleeve, and he quivered as though
it had been a blow. The silence was growing
oppressive with significance. Suddenly Jean
broke it, saying: “Mr. Loring, I may not have
another opportunity of speaking with you alone
while we are in Kay. I must use this chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to tell you what pleasure it has given me to
hear of your achievements here, of your courage
in the riot and of—” Jean paused and seemed
to choose her words carefully, “of your victory.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Stephen, with an attempt
at ease, while all the time his heart was beating
like a trip-hammer, “I suppose Baird has been
talking about me; but you must not take him
too literally. There is no libel law against
flattery, and so men speak their minds about
their friends as freely as they would like to do
about their enemies. Miss Cameron,” he said
suddenly, “I have never thanked you for the
note which you sent me when I left Quentin.
But you must know how grateful I felt. I did
not deserve your trust; but I cannot tell you
how it helped me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly, and when she
spoke her voice was very soft. “I am glad if
it helped you, but you would have won your
fight without it, I think.” Her tone held a
shadow of question.</p>

<p>“The whole struggle would not have seemed
worth while without that, and without the
truest friend in the world to help. Miss Cameron,
Baird Radlett came to me when I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
fallen as low as a man could fall. He and your
note saved me.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Jean, “you saved yourself.
I think you were saved from the time of that
dreadful night at Quentin, only you did not
know it.”</p>

<p>The roar of an ore car rushing by drowned
her voice. A moment later Stephen spoke in
a hard, dry tone. “I am not sure,” he said,
“that I know exactly what salvation means.
If it means that I am not likely to make a beast
of myself any more, or murder any more men,
I am glad to believe it is so; but after all what
does it matter to me? I have lost my chance,
thrown it away, and life cannot hold anything
particularly cheerful for me after that.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Jean exclaimed with a swift inexplicable
pang at her heart. “You must not
say that. There are chances ahead in life for
every one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, chances; but not <em>the</em> chance.”</p>

<p>“Am I <em>the</em> chance?” Jean asked, in a voice
so low that it could scarcely be heard above the
echoes.</p>

<p>Loring bowed his head, with such dejection
in his bearing as struck to the heart of the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
beside him. Jean had been thinking, thinking
hard. The quick throbbing in her temples
attested to the intensity of her mood. She knew
in that instant that she cared for the man
at her side; but how much? Enough to run
the risk?</p>

<p>“Mr. Loring,” she said at length slowly, as
if weighing her words, “I know that you care
for me; but, and it is hard to say”—she laid
her hand on his arm and tried to meet his eyes—“but
I don’t quite trust you.” She felt his arm
stiffen and quiver, but she went on, although
her voice broke: “I know that you are brave.
I owe my life to that.” She paid no attention
to the gesture with which he waved aside all
obligation. “I respect you more than I can say
for the fight that you have made against habit,
only—”</p>

<p>“Only?” echoed Stephen slowly.</p>

<p>“Only—oh, can’t you see that if I were to
marry you and all the time there were in my
heart a doubt, even though the merest shadow,
that neither of us could be happy?”</p>

<p>Loring crushed between his fingers a piece of
the soft ore and let the fragments trickle to the
ground before he spoke. “It is more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
year now, Jean. Must the shadow last forever?
Is what I have done to remain forever unpardoned?”
He spoke with the slowness of
an advocate who knows his case is lost, yet
fights to the end.</p>

<p>“It is not that, Stephen. I could forgive
almost anything that you have done. But there
is one thing that you have done, that try as I
would, I could never forget. Stephen, let me
ask it of you. What is the most essential quality
of all in a—a—friend?”</p>

<p>“Honesty,” answered Loring, without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p>“And suppose you knew that a friend had
utterly fallen from honesty?”</p>

<p>“I should then feel that the word “friend”
no longer applied.”</p>

<p>Loring was dazed. He did not know of her
cousin’s story of his dishonesty in his relations
with his guardian. He thought only of the
promise he had made to her on their ride in
Quentin and the manner in which he had
broken it. “Yes,” he went on slowly, “I
suppose when a man breaks his solemn word
he shatters forever the mold of his character.”</p>

<p>“I want you to understand that it is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
because I cannot forget that one thing, that my
trust in you is not absolute.”</p>

<p>Loring straightened himself, and for a second
turned his head away. “That,” said he, “is
why I said I had lost <em>the</em> chance.”</p>

<p>A wave of pity swept over Jean. “And yet,
Stephen,” she whispered, “I—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Steve! Where are you?” came from
out of the darkness. “We are going up now.
Mr. Cameron thinks we have a fine strike
there.”</p>

<p>Stephen helped Jean to her feet. Then
silently he led the way back to the shaft.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Inanimate things, the poets to the contrary,
do not share human moods. When
Loring returned to his desk in the office
the typewriter, instead of showing the least
sympathy, behaved abominably. Ordinarily
the letter “J” on a well-constructed machine
is on the side, and little used. But this afternoon
it seemed to insist on beginning every word,
and the effect on the business letters which should
have been composed was not beneficial. But
this is perhaps explained by the few terse words
concluding the pamphlet of directions which
accompanied the machine: “No machine ever
made is <em>fool proof</em>.” So Loring had the extra
task of carefully proofreading all his letters.
Being in love always has one of two effects on
a man’s work. He either does twice as much
work half as well, or half as much work twice
as well; but no man truly in love has been able
to reverse these, and double both his zeal and
efficiency. This kind of inspiration has a singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
disregard for detail, and when it does
deign to notice the minute side of things, it
magnifies them to such an extent that the ultimate
aim is likely to be obscured. As proof of
the above statement, between luncheon and
supper time, Stephen accomplished twice his
usual amount of work with a little less than
half his customary efficiency.</p>

<p>His work done, Loring banged the cover onto
the typewriter with a little more force than was
necessary, for if inanimate things cannot share
moods, they are still delightful objects on which
to vent overwrought feelings. Stephen’s hat
was on the table behind the swivel chair, and
it was characteristic of him that he used great
exertion to secure it without rising, twisting
the chair into positions which defied all the laws
of gravity. Having set the soft hat at its accustomed
slightly tilted angle, he lit his pipe and
frowned at the garish appearance of the yellow
oak of his desk. Then he rose with the indecisive
motion of one who, when on his feet,
wonders why he has left his chair. Ordinarily
Stephen was a trifle late at supper on account
of staying to lock up the office, and to-night
from an illogical dread of the thing which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
half longed for, half wished to avoid, a talk
with Jean, he did not reach the table until all
the others had left.</p>

<p>Wah glided in from the kitchen with a fresh
pot of coffee which he set before Stephen, together
with the choicest selections from the
supper which he had as usual saved for him.
When Loring rose from the table, leaving the
larger portion of his meal uneaten, Wah looked
at him reproachfully from the inscrutable depths
of his slanting eyes.</p>

<p>Baird Radlett, Jean, and a few others were
still gathered on the porch when Stephen
stepped outside. They were gazing intently
down the valley to the westward at the glorious
afterglow in the sky, where, but an instant
before, the red rim of the sun had flashed before
dipping behind the hills. All were silent with
that quietness which is brought forth by moments
of absolute beauty. Loring’s step and
voice aroused them, and all save Jean turned
quickly. Baird saw a color in Jean’s cheeks
far richer and softer than the deep rose hue
in the skies. He glanced quickly from her to
the man standing above her, who was looking
down at her with adoration in his gaze. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
one second his love for the girl battled with his
friendship for the man, and Radlett realized
the full bitterness of the sacrifice that he was
making. Then friendship conquered, and he
comprehended and sympathized with the sorrow
which to-night made Loring’s face look singularly
old.</p>

<p>Stephen stayed with them only a few minutes
before returning to the office to play
the old, old game of burying thought beneath
routine.</p>

<p>Radlett and Jean were left alone on the steps.
Baird watched Stephen until he was hidden by
the angle of the office.</p>

<p>“Loring,” he said suddenly, turning to Jean,
“has been working fifteen hours a day for the
last six months. He cannot stand it. I am
afraid for him.”</p>

<p>“Afraid for his—for his—” she hesitated
moment, “for his health?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and only for his health,”, answered
Radlett decisively. He rose to his feet as if to
gain strength for what he was going to say.
Then he seated himself again on the step beside
her. Drawing a deep breath he began: “Jean,
you are not looking well, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean murmured something about the fatigue
of the journey from the East.</p>

<p>“No,” said Radlett firmly, “it is not that.
It is something deeper than that. You know
it is, and I know it, too, so let there be no
concealments between us!”</p>

<p>“What do you know? How do you know
it?” Jean stammered.</p>

<p>“A man knows some things by instinct,”
Radlett answered. “I think I should have
found this out before long, anyhow; but your
face, dear, is not good at concealments, and
when I saw your eyes, which had been sad from
the time we met in Tucson, suddenly light at
the sight of Loring in the office here, when
heard the little catch in your voice (Jean, I
know every tone of your voice by heart) and
when I saw and heard you, I knew!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Baird!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” exclaimed Radlett, “we will
not talk of that any more. I only wanted you
to understand that we must be quite frank with
each other, and that thus everything will come
out right. Now tell me how things stand with
you.”</p>

<p>“How can I, Baird? To you, of all people?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can and you must, just because I am
I and you are you, and your happiness concerns
me more than anything in the world. You love
Stephen Loring. You are miserable about him.
Why?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” answered Jean slowly,
looking intently out into the darkness. “I will
tell you why I am afraid for him, because you
are his friend as you are mine, and you will
understand. I am afraid that it is only for my
sake that he has made his reform, and I told
him to-day that I did not quite trust him, and
that—oh, Baird, you must understand!”</p>

<p>Radlett bowed his head in grave assent.
“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>“But,” Jean went on, “if you think that
this will cause him to fall again, I cannot bear
it; for Baird, I do care for him, and if this is
his last chance, I will give it to him.”</p>

<p>Radlett grasped her hand firmly in his own
and bent over her. No crisis of his life had ever
taxed his self-control like this.</p>

<p>“Jean,” he said slowly, “he does not need
you. Do you suppose that if he did I should
think him worthy the great gift of your love?”
Baird’s voice broke, in spite of himself; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
controlled it and went on: “Stephen has fought
his fight and won it as it must be won—<em>alone</em>.
Do you know what he has been since he left
your father? Do you know of the way he behaved
in that fight in Mexico, of the way in
which he has saved the mine here, of the strength,
the powers, the self-discipline that he has shown.
It must be something stronger than his love for
a woman that will save such a man as Loring,
when he has once started down hill. Stephen
had that ‘something stronger.’ God help him,
it cut to the bone! Since that accident, Loring
has never been quite his old self. I am afraid
he never will be, that he will always be under
a cloud, but Jean, it saved him. He has won
his fight without you, and for that reason he
is worthy of you.” Baird felt the fingers in his
own tighten in their grasp. “Jean,” he went
on, “you know how I have cared for you ever
since we were children, and how, although you
did not care,” he cut short her protestation
quickly, “and how although you did not care
in that way, I love you now above anything on
earth.”</p>

<p>The tears gathered hot in Jean’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You know that as I told you a moment ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
your happiness is the highest thing in the world
to me, and I say to you: if you love Stephen,
marry him. If you do not love him, then I am
sorry for him, but I am not afraid for him. I
am proud of him.”</p>

<p>“He must be a man, Baird, to have such a
friend as you.”</p>

<p>A deep silence fell between them. Then
Radlett rose suddenly, for he knew his endurance
could stand no more. He bent over her
hand and kissed it tenderly. Then with a heart-rendingly
cheerful “good night,” he strode off
into the darkness towards his quarters.</p>

<p>For an hour Jean sat on the steps, watching
the lights of the camp, as one by one they were
extinguished, until one light alone burned. It
was in the window of the office. There she
knew a man was working steadily and bravely,
and her heart beat irregularly as the realization
came, that it was the man whom with her whole
heart she loved and trusted for all the future,
whatever might have been the past. The hot
blood came surging into her cheeks only to recede
and leave them pale.</p>

<p>Rising, she walked slowly across to the office.
She hesitated a moment, her hand on the door-knob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
then throwing back her head proudly,
she opened the door softly and entered. Her
bearing was that of a soldier who surrenders
without prejudice to his pride.</p>

<p>Loring was bending over his work and did
not see her as she stood in the doorway. She
watched his pen toiling over the paper before
him. The drooping dejection in his whole attitude
cried out to her of his need for her.</p>

<p>“Stephen!” she half whispered.</p>

<p>The man jumped to his feet, startled by the
sound of the voice of which he had been thinking.
He turned to her, his face white and tense
with the strain of wonder and surprise. In
three steps he crossed the room to her.</p>

<p>“Is anything wrong?” he exclaimed anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, something is wrong,” she answered,
looking steadily into his eyes. “I was wrong.
I told you that I did not trust you. I do.”</p>

<p>“Jean,” he gasped, half suffocated. “Do
you mean that after I had broken my word to
you at Quentin, you could possibly forgive?”</p>

<p>“I forgave that at the time.”</p>

<p>His face was drawn with the conflict between
an impossible hope and a desperate fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was the only time in my life that I
ever broke my word, Jean, but breaking it to
you made it impossible for you to believe in
me. You told me so this morning, and I realized
it. You forgive me that now,” he cried, with a
sudden flash of intuition, “because you are
afraid that in losing you, I shall lose myself
again. Jean, though you are all there is in life
for me, I will not let you sacrifice yourself to
your splendid sympathy. Dearest, can’t you
see that, as you said; if there were a shadow of
doubt on your mind you could never be happy
with me?”</p>

<p>“It was not what you think which made me
say I did not trust you. It was something,
Stephen, which I know would be impossible in
the man you are now. I could not put your dishonesty
to your guardian out of my mind, until
I realized that that was no more a part of the
Stephen Loring I know now than the faults
which I had forgiven.”</p>

<p>Loring looked at her in amazement. “My
dishonesty towards my guardian?” he exclaimed.
“Jean, dear, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I was told,” she said sadly, “that you had
borrowed heavily from him, and never returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the loan; but we can pay it back together,” she
went on bravely.</p>

<p>“Jean, every cent that I ever borrowed, I
paid him when I came into my own money.
I don’t know or care where you heard the story,
but the only part of it that is true is that I did
abuse his good nature and ask him to advance
me out of his own fortune the amount that he
held in trust for me.” The impossible hope
conquered the fear in his face. He seized both
of her hands in his and spoke breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Jean, dearest, was that why you did not
trust me?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him with her eyes glowing
with a new feeling. The love that had sprung
from pity had grown into the love based on
pride.</p>

<p>“Do not let us talk of that now,” she whispered,
“but of the present—and—and the
future!”</p>

<p>Stephen drew her to him with a passion which
only those who have despaired can feel. He
bowed his head and kissed her as for months
he had dreamed of doing. He trembled violently
as his lips met hers; trembled with
wonder, with adoration, with perfect happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
He held her tightly in his arms, as though afraid
that all was not real, that he might yet lose her,
as if he drew strength and life from the heart
that beat against his own.</p>

<p>The present redeemed the past and glorified
the future. Through sin and shame, through
failure and humiliation, he had at last found
his strength, and before him in golden promise
stretched the up grade.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>By</i> ANTHONY PARTRIDGE</p>

<p class="center">With illustrations by Will Foster. Cloth. $1.50</p>

<p>This new novel by Anthony Partridge, whose absorbing
romance, “The Kingdom of Earth,” met with instant favor,
has London for its scene. But when you have read it
you will admit that real London, as well as imaginary
Bergeland, is a source of fascinating romance.</p>

<p>The heroine of “Passers-By” is a street singer, Christine,
who comes to London accompanied by Ambrose Drake,
a hunchback, with a piano and a monkey. The fortunes
of these two are strangely linked with those of an English
statesman, the Marquis of Ellingham, who in his
youth has led a wild and criminal career in Paris as the
leader of a band of thieves and gamblers, the Black Foxes.
Here is the material for a thrilling tale in which mystery
breeds adventure and culminates in love.</p>

<p>The first chapter plunges the reader into an interest-compelling
maze of events, and the attention is held to
the end by a series of dramatic situations and surprises.</p>

<p>Mr. Partridge is now reckoned among the favorite novelists
of the day. His first book was “The Distributors,”
the story of a great London mystery. Then came “The
Kingdom of Earth,” one of the popular novels of 1909.
“Passers-By” is his third book.</p>

<p>The book is an inspiration.—<cite>Boston Globe.</cite></p>

<p>Without qualification one of the worthiest publications
of the year.—<cite>Pittsburg Post.</cite></p>

<p>Aunt Jane has become a real personage in American
literature.—<cite>Hartford Courant.</cite></p>

<p>A philosophy sweet and wholesome flows from the lips
of “Aunt Jane.”—<cite>Chicago Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p>The sweetness and sincerity of Aunt Jane’s recollections
have the same unfailing charm found in “Cranford.”—<cite>Philadelphia
Press.</cite></p>

<p>To a greater degree than her previous work it touches
the heart by its wholesome, quaint human appeal.—<cite>Boston
Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>The stories are prose idyls; the illuminations of a lovely
spirit shine upon them, and their literary quality is as
rare as beautiful.—<cite>Baltimore Sun.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret E. Sangster</span> says: “It is not often that an
author competes with herself, but Eliza Calvert Hall has
done so successfully, for her second volume centred about
Aunt Jane is more fascinating than her first.”</p>

<p class="center">12mo. Decorated Cloth. $1.50</p>

<p>A dramatic story, big and splendid in theme, and
handled in masterly style.—<cite>Albany Times-Union.</cite></p>

<p>Fresh, vigorous, wholesome, well written.... Holding
the absorbed interest from first page to last.—<cite>Chicago
Record Herald.</cite></p>

<p>The best work Mrs. Fenollosa has given us. It will be
one of the best read and most talked about books of the
year. It is intensely human.—<cite>Springfield Union.</cite></p>

<p>The reader must be dull, indeed, who is not stirred and
thrilled by this book, even in the light of a human document.—<cite>Lilian
Whiting in New Orleans Times-Democrat.</cite></p>

<p>A story of emotion, intensely dramatic, and told with
the constructive skill and power of narrative which
Sidney McCall has evidenced so effectively in her earlier
novels.—<cite>Brooklyn Eagle.</cite></p>

<p>A story of the Southland which promises in a way to do
as much for the white slave of to-day as did “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” for the black man. Besides the problem of child
labor in the mills there is a love story and romance
that keeps the attention of the reader to the very end.—<cite>St.
Louis Globe Democrat.</cite></p>
